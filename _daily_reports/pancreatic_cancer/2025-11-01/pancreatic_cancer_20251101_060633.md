# Pancreatic Cancer: Empowering Your Journey with Advance Care Planning

For informed patients navigating a pancreatic cancer diagnosis, actively engaging in Advance Care Planning (ACP) is crucial. This process ensures your values, preferences, and wishes for future medical care are documented and respected, empowering you to maintain control over your healthcare journey.

## Personalized Care & Treatment Advances

Recent advancements emphasize personalized care, making your preferences central to treatment strategies. New biomarkers like **CA 19-9**, **circulating tumor DNA**, and genetic mutations such as **KRAS, BRCA, and NTRK** are improving diagnostic accuracy. Understanding your specific markers empowers you to ask targeted questions about treatment options.

Targeted therapies offer more precise treatment with fewer side effects. Examples include **PARP inhibitors** like olaparib (Lynparza), FDA-approved for BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer, and **NTRK inhibitors** such as larotrectinib (Vitrakvi) and entrectinib (Rozlytrek), for NTRK fusion-positive cancers. These therapies target specific genetic changes, often improving quality of life. Discuss eligibility, potential benefits, and common side effects (e.g., fatigue, nausea) with your team.

## Understanding Advance Directives

Your advance directives specify your preferences for managing pain, symptom control, and medical interventions. Key legal documents include:
*   **Living Will:** Outlines your wishes for medical treatment in specific end-of-life situations.
*   **Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare (Healthcare Proxy):** Designates someone to make medical decisions if you cannot.
*   **Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) / Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST):** Actionable medical orders for current treatment choices, signed by both you and your doctor.

## Critical Questions for Your Care Team

ACP encourages asking critical questions to align treatment with your goals:
*   What are the expected outcomes (e.g., survival, quality of life) with this treatment?
*   What are the most common and severe side effects, and how are they managed?
*   What are the alternatives, including palliative care or no further active treatment?
*   How will this treatment impact my daily life and ability to pursue my personal priorities?

## Initiating Advance Care Planning

Beyond conversations, take these practical steps:
*   Schedule a dedicated meeting with your care team (oncologist, palliative care specialist, social worker).
*   Involve a social worker or palliative care specialist early; they guide these discussions.
*   Consult an attorney specializing in elder law for proper legal document drafting.
*   Utilize online resources for state-specific forms and guidance.

## Reputable Resources

For reliable information, consult:
*   Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (PanCAN)
*   National Cancer Institute (NCI)
*   Major cancer center websites (e.g., Memorial Sloan Kettering, MD Anderson)

In essence, ACP for pancreatic cancer is an ongoing dialogue. It ensures your voice is heard and your decisions honored, providing peace of mind for both you and your loved ones.
