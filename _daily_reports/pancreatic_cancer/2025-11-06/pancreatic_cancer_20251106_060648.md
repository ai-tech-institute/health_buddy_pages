# Pancreatic Cancer: Empowering Daily Self-Management

For individuals navigating pancreatic cancer, proactive daily self-management through focused diet, tailored exercise, and meticulous symptom tracking is vital. These pillars significantly enhance quality of life, manage treatment side effects, and can even influence therapeutic efficacy.

### Dietary Strategies: Beyond the Basics

Pancreatic cancer often leads to malabsorption and weight loss. A high-calorie, high-protein diet with **pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT)** is often recommended. Take enzymes *with* all meals and snacks, adjusting dosage based on meal size and fat content. Explore different enzyme formulations if needed.

Focus on **small, frequent meals** (6-8 times daily) to ease digestion. Incorporate easily digestible fats like medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). Limit highly processed foods; be cautious with very high-fat meals (without sufficient enzymes) or very fibrous foods (if strictures are present), always noting individual tolerance. Prioritize nutrient-dense options: lean proteins, cooked vegetables, and complex carbohydrates.

**Adequate hydration** is critical; drink plenty of water, broths, or electrolyte-rich fluids, especially with digestive issues or treatment side effects. To manage **nausea or early satiety**, try bland foods, ginger, eating very slowly, and avoiding strong smells.

Consult a registered dietitian specializing in oncology. Ask your oncology team, hospital resources, or professional organizations for referrals.

### Tailored Exercise: More Than Just Walking

Exercise is vital for maintaining muscle mass, reducing fatigue, and improving mood. Focus on **prehabilitation and rehabilitation**, tailored to your fitness and treatment stage. Before surgery, guided walking or light resistance training can improve recovery.

During and after treatment, beneficial **low-impact activities** include walking, cycling, or water aerobics. Progressive resistance training helps combat muscle wasting. **Pelvic floor exercises** can help manage bowel issues. Track energy levels and adjust activity, prioritizing consistency.

**Stop exercising immediately and contact your care team if you experience:** new or worsening pain, dizziness, extreme fatigue, or shortness of breath. Consulting an oncology physical therapist is highly recommended.

### Advanced Symptom Tracking: Your Personal Health Data

Detailed symptom tracking empowers you and your care team. Use a user-friendly, customizable, and secure health tracking app, or a simple physical journal. Record:

*   **Symptom onset, duration, severity** (1-10), triggers, and alleviating factors.
*   **Impact on daily activities.**
*   **Medication timing and dosage.**
*   **Food intake and bowel movements** (daily).
*   **Daily weight tracking** (due to weight loss risk).
*   **Daily blood glucose levels** (due to diabetes risk).

For example, tracking pain relative to meals helps identify digestive issues. Note stool characteristics for malabsorption insights. Beyond tumor markers like CA 19-9, monitor **nutritional markers** (albumin, prealbumin, vitamin D). Ask your care team what specific deviations in your individual results should prompt you to reach out. Understanding trends allows for proactive management and earlier interventions.
