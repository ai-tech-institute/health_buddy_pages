# Pancreatic Cancer: Living Well - Diet, Exercise, and Energy Management

Receiving a pancreatic cancer diagnosis is overwhelming. This summary provides practical, evidence-based strategies for managing diet, exercise, and energy—crucial for living well. Understanding these areas empowers you to actively participate in your care. Your multidisciplinary team, including oncologists, dietitians, physical therapists, social workers, and palliative care specialists, will collaborate to support your overall well-being.

### **Dietary Strategies: Nourishing Your Body**

Pancreatic cancer and treatments often affect digestion. **Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT)**, such as Creon, Zenpep, or Pancreaze, supplements essential enzymes. Take PERT *just before or with the first bite* of every meal and snack containing fat. If you miss a dose but are still eating, take it; if you're done, skip it. Consult your doctor or dietitian if you experience persistent diarrhea, bloating, or weight loss, as your dosage may need adjustment.

**Practical dietary advice:**
*   **Small, Frequent Meals:** Aim for 5-6 smaller, nutrient-dense meals daily to ease digestion and maintain energy.
*   **Prioritize Protein:** Lean proteins (chicken, fish, eggs, legumes) and easy-to-prepare snacks like Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, hard-boiled eggs, or protein shakes are vital for healing and muscle mass.
*   **Healthy Fats (if tolerated):** Discuss easily digestible fats like those in MCT oil or olive oil with your dietitian for essential calories.
*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
*   **Liquid Nutritional Supplements:** If solid food is difficult, discuss supplements like Boost or Ensure with your dietitian for extra calories and nutrients.

An **oncology dietitian** is invaluable for personalized plans.

### **Exercise and Physical Activity: Gentle Movement for Strength**

Maintaining activity combats fatigue, preserves muscle strength, improves mood, and enhances well-being.

**Key considerations:**
*   **Start Slow:** Begin with gentle activities like short walks, stretching, or light yoga.
*   **Consistency:** Aim for consistent, brief periods (e.g., 10-15 minutes of walking a few times daily).
*   **Gentle Strength:** Try chair stands, wall push-ups, or light resistance bands at home.
*   **Consult Your Team:** Discuss any new regimen with your doctor or physical therapist.
*   **Red Flags:** Stop immediately and seek medical attention for chest pain, severe dizziness, or sudden shortness of breath during exercise.

### **Energy Management: Pacing Yourself**

Fatigue is common. Effective energy management is crucial.

**Strategies:**
*   **Prioritize Rest & Sleep Hygiene:** Schedule regular rest. Improve sleep by maintaining a consistent schedule, creating a comfortable environment, and avoiding screen time before bed.
*   **Pace Activities:** Break tasks into smaller steps. Alternate active periods with rest.
*   **Delegate & Accept Help:** Ask loved ones for assistance.
*   **Mind-Body Techniques:** Deep breathing, meditation, or gentle stretching can reduce stress.
*   **Track Your Energy:** Use a journal or a 1-10 scale throughout the day to identify fatigue triggers. For example, if grocery shopping exhausts you, break it into two trips or ask for help.
*   **Cognitive Fatigue ("Chemo Brain"):** Address mental fogginess with brain games or by breaking down mental tasks.

**When to Contact Your Healthcare Team:**
Contact your team immediately for uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, severe weight loss, new or worsening pain, inability to perform daily tasks, or persistent fevers. Proactive engagement with your care team is instrumental in navigating your journey.
