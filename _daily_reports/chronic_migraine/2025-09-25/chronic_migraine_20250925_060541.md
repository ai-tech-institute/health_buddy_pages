# Chronic Migraine: Building Your Multidisciplinary Care Team

For those newly diagnosed with chronic migraine, the journey can feel daunting. Effective management often involves a team of specialists, offering comprehensive care beyond just pain relief to improve your quality of life.

### Key Members of Your Migraine Care Team:

1.  **Neurologist/Headache Specialist:** Your primary expert. They are updated on treatments like **CGRP inhibitors**, which block a pain signal (calcitonin gene-related peptide). These FDA-approved medications (e.g., Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, Nurtec ODT, Vyepti) come as injections or oral forms for prevention or acute treatment; common side effects include constipation or injection site reactions. **Botox injections**, specifically approved for chronic migraine (15+ headache days/month), involve multiple injections around the head and neck every 12 weeks, with potential neck pain or headache. **Advanced diagnostics**, like an MRI, rule out other conditions. If your MRI is "normal," ask: "Does this mean there are no structural issues causing my headaches?" or "What specifically were you looking for, and what do these results tell us about my migraines?"

2.  **Pain Management Specialist:** Migraine is a pain disorder. They offer therapies like **nerve blocks and trigger point injections** (local anesthetic, sometimes steroid, into specific nerves/muscles) for short-term relief or to break pain cycles, with temporary soreness or bruising. **Neuromodulation devices** (e.g., Cefaly, Nerivio) are non-invasive, drug-free options using electrical stimulation to block pain signals. FDA-cleared and often prescription-based, they can be used for daily prevention or acute treatment.

3.  **Physical Therapist:** An invaluable resource, especially for musculoskeletal issues like neck pain or poor posture. They provide personalized exercises and ergonomic advice. To find a specialized PT, ask your neurologist for a referral or seek those with experience in craniofacial pain, cervicogenic headaches, or TMD.

4.  **Mental Health Professional:** Chronic pain impacts mental well-being. Therapists skilled in chronic pain management teach coping strategies like **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**, which helps change negative thought patterns, or **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)**, focusing on accepting pain and living by your values. These therapies reduce migraine disability and improve mood. Ask for referrals or seek 'health psychologists' or therapists specializing in chronic illness.

5.  **Dietitian/Nutritionist:** Certain foods can trigger migraines. A registered dietitian can guide you through an **elimination diet** to identify triggers, ensuring nutritional adequacy. This should always be professionally guided. Seek dietitians specializing in migraine or food sensitivities.

6.  **Pharmacist:** A critical, often underutilized resource. They provide essential information on medication interactions, side effects, and proper administration. Ask: "Are there any OTC medications or supplements I should avoid with my current prescriptions?", "What's the best way to take this medication to minimize side effects?", or "Can you explain how to properly use my acute migraine medication?"

### Practical Guidance for Newly Diagnosed Patients:

*   **Be Your Own Advocate:** Maintain a detailed migraine diary. Track frequency, severity, triggers, medications, side effects, associated symptoms (aura, nausea, light/sound sensitivity), impact on daily activities, sleep patterns, stress levels, menstrual cycle, and weather changes. Use dedicated apps or templates for consistency.

*   **Seek Comprehensive Care:** Don't hesitate to ask for referrals. Try phrasing like, "I've heard a multidisciplinary approach helps chronic migraine, and I'm interested in exploring options like physical therapy or working with a pain management specialist. Would you provide a referral or recommend someone?"
