# Chronic Migraine: Building Your Multidisciplinary Care Team – Beyond the Neurologist

If you're newly diagnosed with chronic migraine – defined as experiencing headaches on 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months, with at least 8 of those days having migraine features – understanding that effective management extends beyond a single specialist is crucial. While your neurologist is central, a multidisciplinary team offers a holistic approach, improving outcomes and enhancing your quality of life.

### The Essential Team Members (Beyond Your Neurologist)

1.  **Pain Management Specialist:** These physicians offer advanced treatments. **Botox (onabotulinumtoxinA)**, FDA-approved for chronic migraine, is for adults (18+) with 15+ headache days/month (8+ migraine features) who've failed other preventives. Given every 12 weeks, common side effects include neck pain or eyelid drooping. **Nerve blocks** involve injecting anesthetics or steroids to temporarily block pain signals from specific nerves, with potential temporary risks. They also utilize **non-opioid strategies** like trigger point injections, physical modalities, or non-opioid medications (e.g., certain anticonvulsants, antidepressants, CGRP inhibitors).
2.  **Physical Therapist:** Migraine often links to neck tension, posture, or TMJ. A PT specializing in headache/craniofacial pain can assess and treat these issues. Ask your neurologist for referrals, or seek therapists with craniofacial pain certifications or clinics specializing in TMD/TMJ.
3.  **Mental Health Professional:** Chronic pain significantly impacts mental well-being. A therapist, especially one experienced with chronic pain/illness and trained in CBT or ACT, can teach coping strategies, stress reduction, and manage anxiety/depression. Biofeedback can also help control physiological responses.
4.  **Dietitian/Nutritionist:** Certain foods can trigger migraines. A registered dietitian can help identify triggers via an elimination diet and guide you toward an anti-inflammatory eating plan. **Always discuss significant dietary changes with your neurologist or primary care physician first**, especially if on medications or with other health conditions.

### Practical Guidance for Building Your Team

*   **Communicate with Your Neurologist:** Discuss your interest; they can often provide referrals.
*   **Start Small:** Don't try to assemble the whole team at once. Begin with one or two key specialists beyond your neurologist, prioritizing based on your most pressing symptoms.
*   **Keep Detailed Records:** Maintain a headache diary. Track: date/time of onset/end, severity (1-10), specific symptoms (aura, nausea, light/sound sensitivity), potential triggers (stress, weather, foods, sleep), medications taken (dose/time) and their effectiveness, and impact on daily activities. Share this with all team members.
*   **Understand Insurance & Cost:** Check with your insurance provider about coverage for different specialists and therapies, including co-pays or deductibles. Hospital financial counselors or social workers can often help navigate these aspects.

Embracing a multidisciplinary team empowers you to take an active role in managing your chronic migraine, moving beyond symptom suppression to a more comprehensive and effective path toward relief and improved well-being.
