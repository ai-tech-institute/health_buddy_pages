## Chronic Migraine: Choosing Your Migraine Preventive

Living with chronic migraine can be challenging, but selecting the right preventive treatment can significantly improve quality of life. This guide explores CGRP inhibitors, Botox, and oral therapies, offering insights for informed decision-making.

### CGRP Inhibitors: Targeted Relief

CGRP inhibitors precisely target the CGRP pathway, a key player in migraine pain. They come in two forms:

*   **Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs):** Injected (Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, Vyepti) or infused (Vyepti), these are FDA-approved for chronic migraine prevention. Often considered after failing two or more traditional oral preventives. Side effects include injection site reactions and mild constipation. Less common but important: severe constipation, hypertension (especially Aimovig), or hypersensitivity reactions. Contact your doctor for severe or persistent issues.
*   **Gepants (Oral):** Qulipta is approved for chronic migraine prevention. Nurtec ODT is for acute treatment and *episodic* migraine prevention, while Ubrelvy is for acute treatment only. Common side effects include nausea, fatigue, and constipation.

### OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox): A Different Approach

Botox is FDA-approved for chronic migraine prevention (15+ headache days/month) and is typically considered after other oral preventives have failed or caused intolerable side effects. It involves 31-39 small injections into head and neck muscles every 12 weeks, dampening pain signals. Common side effects include neck pain, muscle weakness, temporary drooping eyelid (ptosis), headache, or stiff neck. These usually resolve within weeks; contact your doctor if severe or concerning.

### Oral Preventive Therapies: The Foundation

Traditional oral medications remain valuable. Some are FDA-approved for migraine prevention (e.g., Topiramate, Propranolol); others are commonly used off-label (e.g., Amitriptyline).

*   **Topiramate:** Can cause "brain fog," tingling, weight loss, kidney stones.
*   **Valproate:** Associated with weight gain, hair loss, liver issues. **Strong warning: can cause severe birth defects; avoid if pregnant or planning pregnancy.**
*   **Amitriptyline:** May cause dry mouth, constipation, sedation, weight gain.
*   **Beta-blockers (e.g., Propranolol):** Can lead to fatigue, dizziness, low blood pressure, or worsen asthma/COPD.

### Practical Guidance for Informed Choices

Choosing the right preventive requires collaboration with your neurologist:

1.  **Migraine Diary:** Track migraine days/month, severity (0-10 scale), duration, acute medication doses, and impact on daily activities.
2.  **Success & Timing:** A 50% reduction in migraine days is a common goal. Also, look for reduced severity and improved daily function. Assess efficacy after 2-3 months for oral therapies, or 3-6 months for CGRPs/Botox. Patience is key.
3.  **What if it's not working?** Discuss dose adjustments, trying another medication within the same class, or switching to a different class of preventives with your neurologist. Open communication is vital.

The evolving landscape of chronic migraine prevention offers more tailored options. Engaging actively with your healthcare provider, armed with knowledge, is your best strategy.
