# Chronic Migraine: Navigating Non-CGRP Preventive Medications

For those living with chronic migraine (15+ headache days/month), finding effective prevention is vital. While CGRP-targeted therapies are new, established non-CGRP medications offer significant relief through diverse mechanisms. Understanding these options empowers you to partner with your healthcare provider.

## Key Non-CGRP Preventives

*   **OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox)**: **FDA-approved** for chronic migraine, Botox is administered every 12 weeks into head/neck muscles. It's typically for adults 18+ who have tried and failed other oral preventives. Patients often see 8-9 fewer headache days monthly. Side effects can include neck pain, headache, or rarely, temporary eyelid drooping (ptosis) or eyebrow asymmetry. Contact your doctor if these occur.

*   **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**: Like amitriptyline, these are often prescribed off-label at low doses. They affect pain pathways. Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, weight gain, blurred vision, and dizziness. Discuss with your doctor if you have heart conditions or glaucoma.

*   **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol and metoprolol are often used off-label. They stabilize blood vessels and reduce nerve excitability. Side effects can include fatigue, cold hands/feet, and exercise intolerance. Important contraindications include asthma, certain heart blocks, or diabetes; disclose your full medical history.

*   **Anti-Seizure Medications**:
    *   **Topiramate (Topamax)**: **FDA-approved** for migraine prevention. Common side effects include tingling, appetite changes, and "Topamax fog" (cognitive slowing, word-finding difficulty). Less common but serious risks include kidney stones, glaucoma (rare), and metabolic acidosis. Ensure good hydration and regular eye exams.
    *   **Valproate (Depakote)**: Often used off-label. Side effects can include weight gain, hair loss, tremor, and GI upset. Regular liver function tests are crucial. **Important:** It carries significant risks for women of childbearing potential due to birth defect concerns.

## Practical Guidance for Patients

1.  **Discuss Your Full Medical History:** Be transparent about all conditions, medications, and pregnancy plans to ensure safe, effective choices.
2.  **Understand Side Effects:** Know what to expect and how to manage potential side effects to improve adherence.
3.  **Track Migraine Days and Symptoms:** A detailed migraine diary is invaluable. Track:
    *   Frequency, severity, and duration
    *   Triggers (stress, foods, weather)
    *   Associated symptoms (nausea, aura)
    *   Pain location
    *   Impact on daily activities
    *   Acute medication use
    *   **Interpret Results:** Look for a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days as a common goal. Identify patterns.
    *   **Take Action:** Bring your diary to every appointment. If severe or unexpected side effects occur, contact your doctor immediately.
4.  **Be Patient:** Preventive medications take time. Oral preventives often take 4-8 weeks to show initial effects, while Botox requires a full 12-week cycle to assess impact. Consistent use is vital.

Exploring these non-CGRP options offers diverse pathways to manage chronic migraine, providing hope and improved quality of life.
