# Chronic Migraine: Your Essential First Step – Symptom Tracking

A new chronic migraine diagnosis can feel daunting. Your most powerful initial tool is consistent, detailed symptom tracking. This isn't just about pain; it's how you and your doctor unlock your unique migraine patterns, identify triggers, and build an effective treatment plan together.

**Why Tracking is Crucial:**

1.  **Uncovering Triggers & Taking Action:** Tracking helps pinpoint triggers like specific foods, weather changes, stress, or lack of sleep. If you consistently identify a trigger (e.g., late nights, a particular food), try avoiding or mitigating it for 2-4 weeks. Observe if this reduces your migraine frequency or severity, and discuss these findings with your doctor.

2.  **Early Intervention with Migraine Phases:** Migraines have distinct phases: prodrome (fatigue, mood changes), aura (visual disturbances), headache (throbbing pain, nausea), and postdrome (lingering fatigue). Recognizing prodromal symptoms through tracking can signal the optimal time to take acute medication as prescribed by your doctor, often improving its effectiveness.

3.  **Optimizing Treatment:** Tracking objectively shows if medications are working.
    *   **Acute Treatments (e.g., Triptans):** Used to stop a migraine attack once it starts. Track when you take them, dosage, and how quickly symptoms improve. Be aware of common side effects like tingling or chest pressure. Triptans are generally not for those with uncontrolled high blood pressure or heart disease.
    *   **Preventive Treatments (e.g., CGRP Inhibitors):** FDA-approved for migraine prevention, these include self-injected options like Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, and the intravenous infusion Vyepti. Track their effectiveness and side effects (e.g., injection site reactions, constipation, fatigue). These are often considered when other preventives haven't worked or for frequent migraine days.

4.  **Informing Your Doctor:** Your detailed log provides an accurate snapshot of your condition, enabling a productive discussion with your neurologist for personalized care.

**Practical Guidance & Holistic Approach:**

Track for at least 2-4 weeks initially to identify patterns, and continue consistently as your doctor recommends. Record: date/time, pain severity (1-10), associated symptoms (nausea, aura), potential triggers, medications (dose, time, effectiveness, side effects), sleep, and diet.

Beyond medication, tracking also helps monitor non-pharmacological strategies. If stress or sleep are triggers, incorporate and track basic stress management (mindfulness, relaxation) and a regular sleep schedule. This holistic approach, guided by your tracking data, empowers you toward better migraine management and improved quality of life.
