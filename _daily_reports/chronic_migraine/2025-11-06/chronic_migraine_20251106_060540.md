# Chronic Migraine: Your Personalized Emergency Action Plan

Being newly diagnosed with chronic migraine can be daunting. Developing a personalized Migraine Emergency Action Plan is a vital step to regain control, reduce anxiety, and proactively manage attacks. This plan is a comprehensive strategy to minimize impact and ensure you know exactly when and how to seek help.

### Core Components of Your Personalized Plan:

1.  **Identify Your Triggers & Prodrome:** Use a **migraine diary** (apps like Migraine Buddy are helpful) to track triggers (foods, stress, weather, sleep) and early warning signs (prodrome) like fatigue or neck stiffness. If stress is a consistent trigger, your plan might include daily mindfulness or setting boundaries. Recognizing these cues allows for earlier intervention.

2.  **Acute Treatment Arsenal:** Work with your neurologist to establish a tiered approach.
    *   **Fast-Acting Medications:** These FDA-approved treatments include **triptans** (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan) and newer **CGRP-targeting acute treatments** (e.g., ubrogepant, rimegepant). Triptans work by affecting serotonin to constrict blood vessels and block pain signals, while CGRP-targeting treatments block a specific protein involved in transmitting migraine pain. Your plan details *which* medication, *exact dosage*, and *when* (ideally at the first sign).
        *   **Side Effects:** Triptans can cause chest tightness, tingling, or flushing. CGRP-targeting treatments may cause nausea or fatigue.
        *   **Important:** Triptans may not suit those with certain heart conditions, uncontrolled high blood pressure, or a history of stroke. Discuss your full medical history with your doctor.
    *   **Rescue Medications:** For severe attacks, a "rescue" medication should be outlined. Examples include strong NSAIDs (e.g., naproxen, diclofenac) or anti-nausea drugs (e.g., ondansetron, promethazine).
    *   **Administration:** Discuss oral, nasal spray, or injectable forms, understanding their different onset times.

3.  **Non-Pharmacological Interventions:** Integrate comfort measures like resting in a dark, quiet room, applying cold/hot packs, staying hydrated, or relaxation techniques.

4.  **Emergency Escalation Protocol:**
    *   **When to Call Your Doctor:** If a migraine lasts longer than usual, acute medications aren't working, or new concerning symptoms appear.
    *   **When to Seek Urgent Care/ER:** For the "worst headache of your life," a sudden "thunderclap" headache, headaches with fever and stiff neck, seizures, or new neurological deficits (weakness, vision loss, speech difficulty). Always carry your medication list, allergies, and doctor's contact.

### Practical Guidance:

*   **Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** Using acute medications too frequently (typically >2-3 days/week) can worsen migraines. Your plan must define medication limits. **Explicitly track the number of days you take acute medications each month in your migraine diary** to prevent MOH.
*   **Understanding Your Medications:** Always ask your pharmacist for a detailed medication information sheet and review the patient information leaflet. Ask questions if anything is unclear.

Developing this plan empowers you to take control, transforming uncertainty into a clear, actionable strategy for managing chronic migraine.
