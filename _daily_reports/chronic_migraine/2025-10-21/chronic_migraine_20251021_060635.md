# Chronic Migraine: Specialist Care for Better Living

For those newly diagnosed with chronic migraine, understanding your healthcare options is vital. Chronic migraine means experiencing headache on 15 or more days a month for over three months, with at least eight days fulfilling migraine criteria. This debilitating condition requires informed choices about your care.

### General Neurologist vs. Headache Specialist

A **general neurologist** diagnoses and manages a range of neurological conditions, including initial migraine cases. They can prescribe common acute and preventive medications (e.g., triptans, beta-blockers). They are an excellent first point of contact for many, especially for episodic migraines or less complex chronic cases.

However, a **headache specialist** is a neurologist with additional, rigorous fellowship training focused solely on headache disorders. This specialization provides deeper expertise in chronic migraine's complex mechanisms and an expanded toolkit for its management.

### Why a Headache Specialist for Chronic Migraine?

1.  **Advanced Diagnosis:** Specialists excel at distinguishing chronic migraine from other complex headache disorders and recognize comorbidities (e.g., sleep issues, anxiety) that can worsen migraine.
2.  **Access to Advanced Treatments:** Headache specialists offer and manage cutting-edge therapies:
    *   **CGRP Inhibitors:** FDA-approved preventive medications (e.g., Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, Vyepti) targeting migraine pain. Typically self-injected monthly or quarterly, or administered intravenously quarterly. Common side effects include injection site reactions, constipation, and muscle cramps.
    *   **Botox Injections:** FDA-approved specifically for chronic migraine prevention, administered every 12 weeks into specific head/neck muscles. Often considered after other preventives. Side effects can include neck pain, headache, muscle weakness, or temporary eyelid drooping.
    *   **Neuromodulation Devices:** FDA-cleared/approved non-invasive devices. Cefaly (applied to the forehead) and Nerivio (worn on the upper arm) provide acute or preventive relief. Side effects are usually mild, like skin irritation or tingling.
    *   **Infusion Therapies:** Such as DHE for "status migrainosus"—a severe, prolonged migraine attack unresponsive to usual acute treatments. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, or leg cramps.
3.  **Personalized Plans:** Specialists create multi-faceted treatment plans, combining medications with lifestyle changes and behavioral therapies. They are skilled at managing medication overuse headache.
4.  **Clinical Trial Awareness:** Many specialists are involved in research, potentially offering access to new treatments. If exploring trials, consider the commitment, potential risks vs. benefits, and the possibility of receiving a placebo.

### Practical Guidance for the Newly Diagnosed

If your migraines are frequent, severe, debilitating, or not responding to initial treatments, seek a headache specialist.

**Before your appointment:** Keep a detailed headache diary, noting frequency, severity, triggers, symptoms, and medication effectiveness.

**Finding a specialist:**
*   **Resources:** Use the American Headache Society's "Find a Doctor" tool, national migraine advocacy organizations, or inquire through major hospital neurology departments.
*   **Questions to ask:** "What is your philosophy on chronic migraine management?" or "Do you work with a multidisciplinary team?"

While finding a specialist may take time, their expertise can be transformative for chronic migraine management and your quality of life.
