# Chronic Migraine: Your Personalized Action Plan for Acute Treatment and Rescue

For those newly diagnosed with chronic migraine, having a clear plan for acute attacks and a robust rescue strategy is crucial. A personalized migraine action plan empowers you to take control, reduce pain, and improve your quality of life.

## Understanding Your Acute Treatment Options

Acute treatments aim to stop a migraine once it starts. Beyond OTC relievers, several prescription options offer targeted relief:

*   **Triptans:** (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan) Long-approved, these constrict blood vessels and block pain. Common side effects include chest tightness, tingling, or flushing. They are contraindicated for individuals with certain cardiovascular conditions.
*   **Ditans:** (e.g., lasmiditan, FDA-approved 2019) This newer class, like Reyvow, targets serotonin receptors differently, offering an option for those with cardiovascular concerns. It can cause dizziness and drowsiness; avoid driving for at least 8 hours post-dose.
*   **Gepants:** (e.g., rimegepant, ubrogepant, FDA-approved 2019/2020) Oral CGRP receptor antagonists (Nurtec ODT, Ubrelvy) don't cause vasoconstriction, making them safer for some heart patients. They block the CGRP peptide involved in pain. Common side effects include nausea or abdominal pain. Rimegepant also has a preventive indication.

**Early intervention is key.** Taking medication at the first sign of a migraine significantly improves effectiveness.

## Developing Your Rescue Strategies

Rescue treatments are for severe migraines that don't respond to acute therapies or become debilitating.

**When to consider rescue:** If your acute medication hasn't significantly reduced pain within 2 hours, or if your migraine worsens to an unbearable level, it's time to consider your rescue options.

*   **Non-Oral Medications:** For severe nausea/vomiting, nasal sprays (e.g., sumatriptan), injections, or suppositories are vital.
*   **Adjunctive Medications:** Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for nausea or anti-inflammatories (e.g., naproxen) for pain.
*   **Steroids:** For prolonged, severe attacks (status migrainosus), a short course of oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) might break the cycle.
*   **Nerve Blocks:** Occipital nerve blocks, administered by a neurologist or pain specialist, involve an anesthetic injection. They can provide rapid relief lasting weeks to months for severe migraines.

## Building Your Personalized Plan: Practical Guidance

1.  **Migraine Diary:** Your most powerful tool. Track frequency, severity, triggers, and the effectiveness of treatments. Crucially, also note **prodromal symptoms** (e.g., fatigue, mood changes), **aura details**, and **postdrome symptoms** (e.g., brain fog). Use apps or templates to help your doctor identify personalized triggers and the most effective treatments for *you*.
2.  **Understand Your Medications:** Know their differences, side effects, and when to take them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist: "What are potential drug interactions?", "What should I do for severe side effects?", and "What is the maximum number of doses I can take in a given period (e.g., 24 hours, week, month)?" to prevent medication overuse headache.
3.  **Collaborate with Your Healthcare Provider:** Your plan is dynamic. Regular neurologist follow-ups are crucial to adjust treatments based on your diary and needs.
4.  **Consider a Multidisciplinary Approach:** Integrate stress management, biofeedback, physical therapy, and mental health support to enhance outcomes.

By proactively using these strategies, newly diagnosed patients can navigate chronic migraine more effectively, reducing attack impact and improving overall well-being.
