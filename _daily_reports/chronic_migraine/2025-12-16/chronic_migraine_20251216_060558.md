# Chronic Migraine: Diet and Hydration for the Newly Diagnosed

For those newly diagnosed with chronic migraine, understanding the profound impact of diet and hydration is a crucial first step in management. Beyond medication, strategic lifestyle adjustments can significantly reduce migraine frequency and severity.

### Beyond Triggers: Elimination Diets and Key Nutrients

While common triggers like caffeine withdrawal are known, a supervised elimination diet can uncover less obvious culprits. This process, ideally guided by a **healthcare professional specializing in nutrition or a doctor knowledgeable about migraine and diet**, involves removing common sensitivities (e.g., gluten, dairy, soy) for **3-4 weeks**. Foods are then **reintroduced one by one every 3-5 days, starting with a small portion and gradually increasing, while meticulously tracking symptoms** in a detailed diary. This helps identify *individual* triggers.

Nutrient deficiencies are also linked to migraine. **Magnesium (400-600mg daily), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2, 400mg daily), and Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10, 100-300mg daily)** have shown efficacy in clinical trials for migraine prevention. **Magnesium can cause loose stools, and Riboflavin leads to bright yellow urine; CoQ10 is generally well-tolerated but may cause mild GI upset.** It's vital to **consult your doctor before starting any supplements**, especially if you have kidney disease (magnesium caution) or take blood thinners (CoQ10 interaction).

### Consistent Hydration is Key

Dehydration is a potent migraine trigger. Even mild dehydration can constrict blood vessels in the brain. The key is *consistent* hydration, not just drinking when thirsty. Be aware that coffee and sugary drinks can contribute to dehydration: **caffeine has a diuretic effect, and high sugar content can have an osmotic effect, drawing water out of cells.**

Aim for **8-10 glasses (2-2.5 liters) of water daily, spread throughout the day**. Consider electrolyte-rich fluids (without artificial sweeteners or excessive sugar) if active or in hot climates. Monitoring urine color (pale yellow is ideal) is a simple way to gauge hydration.

### Decoding Food Labels and Additives

Understanding food labels is paramount. Processed foods often contain additives that trigger migraines. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), artificial sweeteners (aspartame, sucralose), and certain food dyes are implicated. Learn to identify "hidden MSG" in ingredients like "hydrolyzed vegetable protein." **Maintain a detailed food and migraine diary to track potential reactions to identified additives, helping you connect specific ingredients to your symptoms.**

In summary, integrating these dietary and hydration strategies with conventional medical care offers a holistic path toward better migraine management and an improved quality of life.
