# Chronic Migraine: A Caretaker's Guide to Acute Treatment and Emergency Care

For primary caretakers, understanding chronic migraine (15+ headache days/month, 8+ migraine days) and knowing when to seek emergency care is crucial. This guide provides actionable insights for managing acute attacks.

**Acute Medications: Targeted Relief**

While NSAIDs treat mild attacks, targeted options are more effective.

*   **Triptans** (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan): These serotonin receptor agonists treat moderate to severe migraines. Available as oral tablets (onset ~30-60 mins), nasal sprays, and injectables (fastest onset). Common side effects include chest tightness, tingling, flushing, and fatigue. **Crucially, use is limited to 9 days per month to prevent Medication Overuse Headache (MOH).** MOH occurs when frequent use of acute medications paradoxically worsens headaches, making them harder to treat. Triptans are contraindicated with uncontrolled hypertension, heart disease, or stroke history.

*   **Newer Treatments:**
    *   **Gepants** (CGRP receptor antagonists, e.g., ubrogepant, rimegepant) are FDA-approved for acute treatment. Oral, onset ~1-2 hours. They offer an alternative for those with cardiovascular risks or triptan intolerance and can be used more frequently without the same MOH risk. Common side effects: nausea, fatigue.
    *   **Ditans** (e.g., lasmiditan) are FDA-approved and specifically target serotonin 1F receptors without causing vasoconstriction, making them safer for some cardiovascular patients. Oral, onset ~1-2 hours. Common side effects: dizziness, sedation.

**Administering Acute Medications: A Practical Guide**

*   **Act Fast:** Administer medication at the first sign of a migraine, if possible.
*   **Observe:** Monitor for effectiveness and side effects within 30-60 minutes.
*   **Adherence:** Do NOT exceed prescribed dosages to prevent MOH.
*   **Discuss:** Always discuss medication efficacy and side effects with the treating physician.

**The Migraine Diary: An Invaluable Tool**

Maintain a detailed diary to track:
*   Headache severity (1-10 scale).
*   Associated symptoms (aura, nausea, light/sound sensitivity).
*   Identified triggers.
*   Time of attack onset and duration.
*   Exact time medication was taken and time to relief.

This data empowers healthcare providers to optimize treatment.

**When to Seek Emergency Care: Critical Red Flags**

Distinguishing a severe migraine from a medical emergency is vital.

*   **Call 911 Immediately:**
    *   **Sudden, severe "thunderclap" headache:** Reaches peak intensity within seconds to minutes ("worst headache of my life"). Can indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
    *   **Sudden, significant neurological changes:** Weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, vision changes (beyond typical aura), confusion, or loss of consciousness. Signals potential stroke or seizure.

*   **Proceed to ER for Urgent Evaluation:**
    *   **Headache with fever, stiff neck, or rash:** Possible meningitis/encephalitis.
    *   **Headache after head trauma:** Evaluate for concussion or intracranial bleeding.
    *   **New headache in an individual over 50:** Rule out conditions like giant cell arteritis or tumors.
    *   **Concerning changes in usual migraine pattern:** Sudden, drastic shifts in frequency, intensity, or character.

**While Waiting for Help:**
Keep the patient calm and comfortable, ideally in a dark, quiet room if tolerated. **Do not administer additional medication unless instructed by emergency personnel.** Trust your instincts; prompt evaluation can be life-saving.
