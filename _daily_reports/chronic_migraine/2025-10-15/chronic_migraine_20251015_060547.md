# Chronic Migraine: Navigating Your Diagnosis – Criteria and Early Steps

For those newly diagnosed with chronic migraine, understanding the journey ahead begins with clarifying the diagnosis itself. Chronic migraine is more than just frequent headaches; it's a distinct neurological condition defined by specific criteria.

## Understanding the Diagnosis: What is Chronic Migraine?

A diagnosis of chronic migraine can *only* be made by a healthcare professional. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3), its hallmark is experiencing headaches on **15 or more days per month for at least three months**, with at least eight of those days having migraine features. These features often include moderate to severe pain, a pulsating quality, pain worsened by physical activity, and association with nausea/vomiting, light sensitivity (photophobia), or sound sensitivity (phonophobia). Your diagnosis came after your doctor assessed your headache frequency, duration, and associated symptoms, guiding effective treatment strategies.

## Your First Steps After Diagnosis: Empowering Yourself

1.  **Embrace the Headache Diary:** This crucial step helps you and your doctor identify patterns and evaluate treatments. Detail date, time, duration, symptoms, potential triggers, and medications. Bring your detailed diary to every doctor's appointment and be prepared to discuss specific entries; this maximizes its utility for treatment planning. Many apps simplify this process.

2.  **Seek a Specialist:** While your primary care physician may have made the initial diagnosis, consulting a neurologist or headache specialist is highly recommended. These experts possess deep knowledge of complex headache disorders and a broader range of treatment options. Ask your primary care physician for a referral, or utilize resources like the American Headache Society's specialist finder.

3.  **Understand Your Treatment Landscape:** Chronic migraine management is multi-faceted, involving acute (taken at onset) and preventive (taken regularly) treatments. Preventive options have expanded significantly:
    *   **Botox injections:** FDA-approved for chronic migraine, involving injections into specific head/neck muscles. Common side effects include neck pain, muscle weakness, or injection site reactions. Often considered after other oral preventive medications have been tried or are not suitable.
    *   **CGRP inhibitors (e.g., erenumab, fremanezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab):** FDA-approved for migraine prevention, these target specific pathways. Administration varies (e.g., monthly/quarterly self-injection, quarterly IV infusion). Common side effects include injection site reactions or constipation. Often considered after other oral preventives fail.
    Discuss these options thoroughly with your specialist.

4.  **Advocate for Yourself:** Don't hesitate to ask questions. Key questions might include: 'What are the potential side effects of this specific treatment I'm considering?', 'How long should we expect it to take before we know if this treatment is working?', 'What are the next steps if this particular treatment isn't effective for me?', or 'Are there any lifestyle changes or complementary therapies that could support my treatment plan?' Learning to interpret your symptoms and communicate them effectively is key to optimal care.

Being newly diagnosed can feel overwhelming, but understanding the criteria and taking these early, proactive steps can significantly improve your management and quality of life. You are not alone, and effective treatments are available.
