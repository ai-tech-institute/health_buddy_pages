# Chronic Migraine: Navigating Co-occurring Migraine, Depression, and Anxiety Medications

For primary caretakers, understanding medication management when chronic migraine, depression, and anxiety coexist is crucial. This summary offers actionable guidance to optimize patient well-being.

## Dual-Purpose Medications: Benefits and Cautions

Many preventative migraine medications, like tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline) or SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine, duloxetine), also treat depression and anxiety. This can be beneficial, but requires careful monitoring. Common, non-severe side effects include dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, or changes in appetite/sleep. These can often be managed by taking medication with food or adjusting timing.

**Important:** These medications are typically started at a low dose and gradually increased (titration). Never stop them abruptly, as this can lead to withdrawal symptoms. Always discuss dose changes with a healthcare provider.

## CGRP Inhibitors: A Targeted Approach

Newer CGRP inhibitors (calcitonin gene-related peptide inhibitors) like erenumab (Aimovig), fremanezumab (Ajovy), galcanezumab (Emgality), and eptinezumab (Vyepti) have revolutionized chronic migraine care.

*   **FDA Approval:** Erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab are FDA-approved for migraine prevention (including chronic migraine). Eptinezumab is FDA-approved for migraine prevention in adults.
*   **Eligibility:** Typically considered for patients who have failed or cannot tolerate other preventative treatments.
*   **Administration:** Erenumab, fremanezumab, and galcanezumab are subcutaneous injections (self-administered monthly or quarterly). Eptinezumab is an intravenous infusion (administered quarterly).
*   **Side Effects:** Generally well-tolerated, but can include injection site reactions (pain, redness, swelling). Erenumab specifically may cause constipation.
*   **Cost:** These medications can be expensive and often require insurance prior authorization.

While effective for migraine, CGRP inhibitors do not directly treat depression or anxiety, meaning separate management for mood disorders is still necessary.

## Neuromodulation Devices: Non-Pharmacological Support

Non-invasive devices like Cefaly, gammaCore, and sTMS mini can complement pharmacotherapy.

*   **FDA Clearance:** Cefaly and gammaCore are FDA-cleared for both acute and preventive migraine treatment. sTMS mini is cleared for acute and preventive treatment of migraine with aura.
*   **Usage:** Cefaly is applied to the forehead for daily sessions (e.g., 20-60 min). gammaCore is applied to the neck for short sessions (e.g., 2 min). sTMS mini is applied to the back of the head as needed.
*   **Side Effects:** Minor side effects may include skin irritation or temporary muscle contractions.
*   **Cost:** Similar to CGRP inhibitors, these devices can be costly and may require insurance prior authorization.

Some patients report improved mood due to reduced pain, offering an adjunctive approach without drug interactions.

## Practical Guidance for Caretakers:

*   **Medication Reconciliation:** Maintain an updated list of all medications, sharing it with all healthcare providers (neurologist, psychiatrist, primary care physician) and your pharmacist to prevent drug interactions.
*   **Pharmacist's Role:** Your pharmacist is a vital resource for understanding drug interactions, side effects, and proper medication use.
*   **Understanding Side Effects:** Track symptoms using a log: date, medication, dose, observed effect/side effect, severity, and any actions taken. Promptly report new or worsening side effects to the healthcare team.
*   **Optimal Timing:** Discuss optimal medication timing with the healthcare team to maximize effectiveness and minimize daily disruption, especially for sedating drugs or those needing food.
*   **Open Communication:** Facilitate open dialogue between the patient and doctors about treatment preferences, concerns, and impact on daily life and mood.
*   **Pharmacogenomic Testing:** Discuss this emerging strategy with the healthcare team. It can help tailor antidepressant choices based on an individual's genetic profile to improve efficacy and reduce side effects.
*   **Holistic Approach:** Remember medication is one component. Therapy, stress management, and a healthy lifestyle are vital for managing all three conditions.

By staying informed and communicating effectively, caretakers significantly optimize outcomes.
