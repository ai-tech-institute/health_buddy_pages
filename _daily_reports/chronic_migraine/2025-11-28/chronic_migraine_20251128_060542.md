# Chronic Migraine: When to Seek Emergency Care

Living with chronic migraine means recognizing when symptoms signal an emergency. While migraines are debilitating, certain symptom changes demand immediate medical attention.

**Emergency vs. Typical Migraine: Know the Difference**

Distinguish between a severe chronic migraine and a medical emergency. Key indicators for emergency care are **new, different, sudden, worsening, or persistent** symptoms, unlike your usual migraine pattern.

*   **Sudden, Severe Headache (Thunderclap):** An abrupt headache reaching maximum intensity within seconds to a minute. This can signal a stroke or hemorrhage, distinct from typical migraine onset.

*   **New or Worsening Neurological Changes:** Seek immediate care if a migraine involves **new or worsening** neurological symptoms not typical for you:
    *   **Weakness or numbness** on one side.
    *   **Difficulty speaking or understanding speech.**
    *   **Vision changes:** Sudden, complete loss in one eye (amaurosis fugax), or a new, persistent visual field defect, significantly different from usual aura.
    *   **Loss of balance or coordination.**
    *   **Confusion or disorientation.**
    These could indicate a stroke or TIA.

*   **Fever with Stiff Neck:** Headache with high fever and stiff neck can indicate meningitis.

*   **Headache After Head Trauma:** Any severe headache after a head injury, even minor, needs immediate evaluation.

*   **Headache with New Seizures:** A new onset of seizures with a headache is a serious emergency.

*   **Significant Change in Pattern or Unresponsive to Treatment:** If your migraine suddenly changes character, becomes much more severe, or is **unresponsive to usual acute treatments** in an unprecedented way. "Unresponsive" means no significant relief within 2 hours of taking your maximum dose. If this occurs with *new or worsening symptoms*, seek emergency care. Crucial for those over 50 with their first severe headache or significant pattern change.

*   **Vision Loss or Double Vision:** Persistent or sudden vision loss, or new double vision, with a headache can indicate conditions like glaucoma or increased intracranial pressure.

**Practical Guidance: Be Prepared**

If alarming symptoms occur, go to the nearest ER or call emergency services immediately. **Explicitly tell staff your current symptoms are 'different' or 'unprecedented'** compared to your usual attacks.

Be ready to provide:
*   How current symptoms differ from your typical migraine.
*   Usual abortive medications, dosage, and last taken.
*   Exact onset time of *new/concerning* symptoms.
*   Any recent head trauma.
*   All current medications (e.g., blood thinners).
*   Relevant medical history.

Consider creating a "migraine emergency plan" with a designated contact. Recognizing emergency signs is vital for preventing complications and ensuring timely intervention.
