# Chronic Migraine: CGRP Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) for Prevention

For those living with chronic migraine, CGRP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a significant advancement in prevention. These precision-targeted therapies offer a new approach by focusing on Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), a key molecule involved in migraine pain.

**How CGRP mAbs Work:**
CGRP mAbs specifically block CGRP from binding to its receptor, or block the receptor itself, preventing pain signal transmission. This targeted action leads to fewer systemic side effects compared to older, broader-acting preventive medications.

**Key CGRP mAbs and Approval Years:**
Four CGRP mAbs are approved for migraine prevention:
*   **Erenumab (Aimovig):** Approved 2018. Targets the CGRP receptor. Monthly subcutaneous autoinjector.
*   **Fremanezumab (Ajovy):** Approved 2018. Targets the CGRP ligand. Monthly or quarterly subcutaneous autoinjector.
*   **Galcanezumab (Emgality):** Approved 2018. Targets the CGRP ligand. Monthly subcutaneous autoinjector, with a loading dose.
*   **Eptinezumab (Vyepti):** Approved 2020. Targets the CGRP ligand. Administered intravenously every three months, offering rapid onset.

**Eligibility for Treatment:**
CGRP mAbs are generally considered for patients who experience frequent migraines (often 15 or more migraine days per month for chronic migraine) and have not found sufficient relief from, or cannot tolerate, other traditional preventive treatments. They are typically not first-line therapies.

**What to Expect: Efficacy and Timeline:**
Clinical trials show that a significant percentage of patients, often 40-60%, achieve a 50% or greater reduction in monthly migraine days. While some patients, particularly with eptinezumab, may experience rapid relief, the full therapeutic effect across all CGRP mAbs often takes 2-3 months or more to be observed. Consistent use is key.

**Potential Side Effects & When to Act:**
While generally well-tolerated, common side effects can include injection site reactions (for subcutaneous options), constipation (more common with erenumab), fatigue, nausea, muscle cramps, and upper respiratory infections. Rarely, more serious issues like hypertension or hypersensitivity reactions can occur. Contact your doctor if you experience severe pain, swelling, allergic reactions (rash, hives, difficulty breathing), or persistent unusual symptoms.

**Cost and Insurance Coverage:**
CGRP mAbs can be expensive. Research manufacturer patient assistance programs and co-pay cards. Work closely with your doctor's office and insurance provider to understand coverage criteria and potential out-of-pocket costs.

**Tracking Treatment Effectiveness:**
Keep a detailed migraine diary, noting:
*   Frequency, severity, and duration of migraines.
*   Associated symptoms.
*   Use of rescue medications.
*   Any new or worsening side effects.
This information is crucial for informed discussions with your neurologist.

**Important Considerations:**
Discuss all existing health conditions, medications, and known hypersensitivities with your doctor. Data on CGRP mAb use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is limited; therefore, thorough discussion with your healthcare provider is critical if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or breastfeeding.

CGRP mAbs offer a targeted, effective option for many struggling with chronic migraine. Partner with your neurologist to determine if one is right for you.
