# Chronic Migraine: Building Your Migraine Care Team: Beyond the Neurologist

Chronic migraine is a complex neurological condition impacting neurological pathways, psychological well-being, physical function, and daily living. This multifaceted nature demands a diverse care team beyond your neurologist for holistic management and improved quality of life.

**Pain Management Specialist:** These experts offer interventional procedures like nerve blocks or radiofrequency ablation, considered when oral medications fall short. Nerve blocks temporarily numb nerves, while radiofrequency ablation disrupts nerve function for longer relief. Risks include bruising or temporary numbness. Track pain intensity, relief duration, and any new symptoms post-procedure in a diary.

**Physical Therapists:** Crucial for migraine linked to neck pain, TMJ, or posture. Seek a PT specializing in headache/migraine or TMJ; ask, "Do you treat migraine patients?" and "What techniques (e.g., manual therapy, ergonomics) do you use?" Track progress by noting changes in neck/jaw tension and related migraine frequency/intensity.

**Occupational Therapists:** OTs help adapt your environment and routines. Examples: ergonomic workstation adjustments (monitor height, keyboard), light-filtering glasses, activity pacing (scheduled breaks), and managing sensory overload (noise-canceling headphones, quiet spaces).

**Mental Health Professionals:** Psychologists specializing in chronic pain are invaluable. Therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), biofeedback, and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) involve regular sessions (e.g., 8-12 weeks) to build coping skills. Track emotional well-being and stress levels using a mood diary alongside your migraine diary.

**Registered Dietitian or Nutritionist:** A dietitian identifies dietary triggers and guides you toward an anti-inflammatory diet. Common triggers: caffeine withdrawal, aged cheeses, processed meats, artificial sweeteners, MSG. An anti-inflammatory diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and omega-3s. A structured elimination diet under professional guidance is key. Track potential triggers with a detailed food and migraine diary.

**Integrative Medicine Practitioner:** Discuss complementary therapies like acupuncture, which may modulate pain pathways. For supplements, magnesium, riboflavin (B2), and CoQ10 are commonly discussed, with varying evidence. **Always** discuss potential interactions with your neurologist before starting any supplement.

**Conclusion:** Empower yourself by building this diverse team. Ask your neurologist: "Do you have colleagues you refer to for pain management, PT, or mental health that understand migraine?" and "How can we ensure clear communication?" Proactively facilitate communication by bringing notes from one specialist to another or asking for shared treatment summaries.
