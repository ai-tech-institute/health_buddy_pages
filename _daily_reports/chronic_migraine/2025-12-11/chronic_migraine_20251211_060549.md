# Chronic Migraine: Navigating CGRP Inhibitors

For those with chronic migraine (typically 15+ headache days/month, 8+ being migraine, for 3+ months), CGRP inhibitors offer targeted prevention. These therapies block CGRP or its receptor, key to migraine pain pathways. Clinical trials show many patients achieve a 50% reduction in monthly migraine days, with average reductions of 4-6 days.

### Injectable CGRP Inhibitors (FDA-Approved for Prevention)

*   **Erenumab (Aimovig®):** Targets the CGRP *receptor*. Administered via monthly subcutaneous injection.
*   **Fremanezumab (Ajovy®):** Targets the CGRP *ligand*. Administered via monthly or quarterly subcutaneous injection.
*   **Galcanezumab (Emgality®):** Targets the CGRP *ligand*. Administered via monthly subcutaneous injection (with an initial loading dose). Also approved for episodic cluster headache.
*   **Eptinezumab (Vyepti®):** Targets the CGRP *ligand*. Administered via quarterly intravenous (IV) infusion, suitable if you prefer supervised administration.

### Oral CGRP Inhibitors (Gepants)

These offer a different approach:
*   **Rimegepant (Nurtec ODT®):** FDA-approved for both acute and preventive migraine treatment.
*   **Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy®):** FDA-approved for acute migraine treatment.
*   **Zavegepant (Zavzpret®):** FDA-approved for acute migraine treatment.

Common side effects include nausea and fatigue. Important warnings include potential liver impairment and drug interactions; discuss your full medication list with your doctor.

### Important Considerations

1.  **Side Effects:** Common for injectables: injection site reactions, constipation (more with erenumab), nasopharyngitis, fatigue. Less common but serious: severe hypersensitivity reactions or significant constipation requiring intervention, hypertension exacerbation. *Action:* Track severity, duration, and timing of any side effects in your migraine diary. Contact your doctor immediately for severe or unusual reactions.
2.  **Cardiovascular Health:** CGRP plays a role in blood vessel dilation. If you have a history of heart attack, stroke, or uncontrolled hypertension, CGRP inhibitors may require closer monitoring or be contraindicated. *Action:* Ask your doctor: "Given my heart health history, is this CGRP inhibitor safe for me? What specific risks should I be aware of, and how will we monitor them?"
3.  **Monitoring Effectiveness:** Use a detailed migraine diary to track headache frequency, severity, associated symptoms, medication use, and side effects. A reasonable trial period is typically 3-6 months. Look for fewer migraine days, less severe attacks, reduced reliance on acute medications, and improved quality of life.
4.  **Insurance & Cost:** *Action:* Proactively contact your insurance provider *before* starting therapy to understand coverage, co-pays, and prior authorization requirements. Inquire about manufacturer patient assistance programs (PAPs) or co-pay assistance cards, which can significantly reduce costs.

### Key Questions for Your Neurologist

*   Which specific CGRP inhibitor do you recommend, and why?
*   What are the potential side effects, both common and serious, for that specific drug?
*   How will we monitor my progress and side effects?
*   What should I do if the first CGRP inhibitor isn't effective?
*   Are there any lifestyle changes that can enhance treatment?

Finding the right therapy is a collaborative journey. Don't be discouraged if the first CGRP inhibitor isn't fully effective; success often comes with trying another. Open communication with your healthcare provider is paramount.
