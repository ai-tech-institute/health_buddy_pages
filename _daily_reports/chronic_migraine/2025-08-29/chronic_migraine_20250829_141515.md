# Chronic Migraine: Navigating Oral Gepants and Nasal Sprays

For individuals living with chronic migraine, new CGRP-targeted therapies offer hope for improved management. These innovative treatments, including oral gepants and CGRP inhibitor nasal sprays, precisely block the Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) pathway, a key player in migraine pain. This targeted action often leads to effective relief with potentially fewer side effects than older medications.

## Oral Gepants: Flexible Pill Options

Oral gepants are small-molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, providing both acute and preventive treatment options in pill form. They are generally safer for patients with cardiovascular concerns, unlike triptans.

*   **Ubrogepant (Ubrelvy, 2019):** Approved for acute treatment, taken as needed to stop an attack.
*   **Rimegepant (Nurtec ODT, 2020/2021):** Approved for both acute treatment (as needed) and preventive treatment (every other day).
*   **Atogepant (Qulipta, 2021):** Approved for preventive treatment, taken daily.

**Common Side Effects:** Nausea, constipation, and fatigue. If these are persistent or severe, discuss with your doctor.

## Nasal Sprays: Rapid Acute Relief

CGRP inhibitor nasal sprays offer rapid relief for acute migraine attacks, especially useful for those with quick-onset migraines or severe nausea preventing oral medication.

*   **Zavegepant (Zavzpret, 2023):** Approved for acute treatment, used as needed.

**Common Side Effects:** Nasal discomfort, altered taste, and nausea. Ensure proper administration as directed by your doctor. Contact your doctor if side effects are bothersome.

## Eligibility and Important Considerations

These therapies are typically prescribed for patients who haven't responded to other treatments or have contraindications to medications like triptans. While generally well-tolerated, contraindications can include severe liver or kidney impairment, or significant drug interactions with certain medications (e.g., strong CYP3A4 inhibitors). Always provide your doctor with a complete list of your medications.

## Tracking Your Treatment Effectiveness

To maximize treatment benefits, consistent tracking is essential:

*   **For Preventive Therapy:** Monitor migraine frequency, severity, duration, and the number of acute medication days per month.
*   **For Acute Therapy:** Note how quickly the medication works, how long relief lasts, and any side effects experienced.

A detailed migraine diary is invaluable for these observations.

## Questions for Your Neurologist

Empower yourself with these questions during your next appointment:

*   Which specific gepant or nasal spray is best for my migraine pattern?
*   What are the potential side effects I should watch for, and what should I do if they occur?
*   How will we measure if the treatment is working effectively?
*   Can I combine this with my other current medications?
*   What are the expected costs and insurance coverage for these options?

These advancements signify a promising future for more personalized and effective migraine management.
