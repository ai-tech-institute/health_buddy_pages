# Chronic Migraine: Your Guide to Non-Medication Strategies

For those newly diagnosed with chronic migraine, understanding non-pharmacological strategies is a cornerstone of effective management. Alongside medication, diet, exercise, stress reduction, and hydration offer powerful avenues for reducing migraine frequency and severity. This guide provides actionable insights to complement your medical treatments.

### Hydration: A Simple Essential

Dehydration is a common migraine trigger. Aim for consistent water intake throughout the day. Keep a water bottle handy and sip regularly, especially if you're active or in warm climates.

### Diet: Beyond Trigger Foods

Beyond avoiding specific "trigger foods," embrace an **anti-inflammatory diet**. Focus on increasing:
*   **Leafy greens:** Spinach, kale
*   **Berries:** Blueberries, strawberries
*   **Fatty fish:** Salmon, mackerel
*   **Spices:** Turmeric, ginger
*   **Healthy fats:** Olive oil, avocados

Consider limiting refined sugars, trans fats (found in many processed snacks), and excessive red meat.

The **migraine-specific ketogenic diet (MSKD)** shows promise for some but requires strict medical supervision. Be aware of potential "keto flu" symptoms (fatigue, headache, nausea), electrolyte imbalances, or digestive issues, and discuss regular monitoring (e.g., blood tests) with your doctor.

### Exercise: Gentle Movement, Significant Impact

Regular, moderate physical activity *between* attacks can significantly reduce migraine burden. If you're new to exercise or worried about triggers, start slowly:
*   **Begin with gentle activities:** Stretching, short walks (5-10 minutes), or chair yoga.
*   **Gradually increase:** Duration and intensity as tolerated.
*   **Focus on aerobic activities:** Brisk walking, swimming, cycling, or yoga are often well-tolerated.

Exercise helps regulate sleep, reduce stress, and improve mood. Listen to your body and choose activities that feel good.

### Stress Reduction: Your Protective Shield

Stress is a potent migraine trigger. Start with accessible techniques:
*   **Deep breathing exercises**
*   **Progressive muscle relaxation**
*   **Guided meditation** (apps like Calm or Headspace can help)
*   **Gentle stretching**

For more structured support, consider **biofeedback** or **cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)**.
*   **Biofeedback** teaches you to control involuntary bodily functions (like muscle tension) using real-time feedback.
*   **CBT** helps you identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors related to stress and pain.

Ask your neurologist or primary care physician for referrals to specialists in chronic pain management or licensed therapists. Inquire about typical session frequency/duration and check insurance coverage.

### Tracking Your Journey: The Migraine Diary

A detailed migraine diary is invaluable. Track:
*   **Diet and hydration:** What you ate/drank, and when.
*   **Exercise:** Type, duration, intensity.
*   **Migraine onset:** Time, severity (1-10 scale), symptoms, and any relief measures.
*   **Sleep patterns:** Hours slept, quality.
*   **Stress levels:** Daily stress triggers and your response.

Look for patterns: Does a migraine consistently appear 12-48 hours after a specific food, or after a stressful event? Bring your diary to appointments to discuss trends with your healthcare team. This process is trial and error, but it's key to finding what works best for *your* unique condition. Managing chronic migraine is a marathon, and these strategies offer sustainable pathways to improved well-being.
