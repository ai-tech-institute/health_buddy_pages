# Chronic Migraine: Advanced CGRP Therapies for Prevention – Injectables vs. Oral Options

Living with **chronic migraine**—defined as 15 or more headache days per month for at least three months, with at least eight of those being migraine days—means seeking effective prevention is vital. Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) pathway-targeting therapies offer a significant advance, specifically blocking a key molecule involved in migraine pain. These advanced options come as injectables or oral medications, each with unique benefits and considerations.

**Understanding CGRP Therapies & Eligibility**
CGRP is a neuropeptide central to migraine attacks. By targeting CGRP or its receptor, these therapies can significantly reduce migraine frequency and severity. They are typically considered for patients who haven't found relief or can't tolerate traditional preventive medications.

**Injectable CGRP Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)**
These sustained-release injectables bind to the CGRP ligand or block its receptor.
*   **Aimovig (erenumab):** Targets CGRP receptor. Approved May 2018 for migraine prevention. Monthly subcutaneous auto-injector. *Note: Caution with severe uncontrolled hypertension.*
*   **Ajovy (fremanezumab):** Targets CGRP ligand. Approved September 2018 for migraine prevention. Monthly or quarterly subcutaneous auto-injector.
*   **Emgality (galcanezumab):** Targets CGRP ligand. Approved September 2018 for migraine prevention. Monthly subcutaneous auto-injector (initial loading dose).
*   **Vyepti (eptinezumab):** Targets CGRP ligand. Approved February 2020 for migraine prevention. Quarterly intravenous (IV) infusion.

**Patient Benefits & Side Effects:** Injectables offer less frequent dosing, improving adherence. Many see a 50%+ reduction in monthly migraine days. Side effects are generally mild. Injection site reactions (redness, pain, swelling) can be managed with ice or warmth. Constipation (more common with Aimovig) can often be eased with increased fluid and fiber. Vyepti offers immediate systemic exposure, but the full preventive effect for all injectables typically takes several weeks to a few months. Serious allergic reactions are rare; contact your doctor immediately for difficulty breathing or widespread rash.

**Oral CGRP Receptor Antagonists (Gepants)**
These offer a daily pill alternative.
*   **Qulipta (atogepant):** Approved September 2021 for episodic, April 2023 for chronic migraine prevention. Taken daily.
*   **Nurtec ODT (rimegepant):** Approved February 2020 for acute treatment and May 2021 for episodic migraine prevention. Taken every other day for prevention. Dual utility is a unique benefit.

**Patient Benefits & Side Effects:** Oral gepants provide pill convenience, ideal for those avoiding injections. Qulipta shows significant reductions in monthly migraine days. Common side effects include nausea and constipation, usually mild to moderate. Nausea may be managed by taking medication with food or ginger.

**Liver Function Monitoring:** Oral gepants (Qulipta, Nurtec ODT) require liver function monitoring before and during treatment, especially for those with pre-existing liver issues. Your doctor will determine frequency. Elevated liver enzymes may require dose adjustment or discontinuation.

**Key Differences & Practical Guidance**
Choice depends on preference, lifestyle, and clinical factors. While Vyepti offers immediate systemic exposure, the full preventive benefit for all CGRP therapies can take weeks to months.

**Insurance & Cost:** These therapies can be expensive. Discuss coverage with your provider and insurer. Explore manufacturer patient assistance programs (PAPs), co-pay assistance foundations (e.g., Headache & Migraine Policy Forum), or hospital financial counselors.

**Practical Guidance for Informed Patients:**
Track your progress by monitoring monthly migraine days, severity, duration, acute medication use, and side effects. This data empowers you to have an informed discussion with your doctor about which therapy aligns best with your lifestyle, potential side effects, and overall effectiveness.
