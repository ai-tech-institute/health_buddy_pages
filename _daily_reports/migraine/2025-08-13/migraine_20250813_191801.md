# Migraine: Navigating Acute Treatment Options for the Newly Diagnosed

Receiving a migraine diagnosis can feel overwhelming, but understanding acute treatment options is a crucial first step toward managing your condition effectively. Acute treatments are taken at the onset of a migraine attack to stop or significantly reduce its symptoms. For newly diagnosed individuals, navigating the array of over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications is key to finding relief and improving quality of life.

### Over-the-Counter (OTC) Medications: Your First Line of Defense

For mild to moderate migraine attacks, OTC medications can often provide significant relief. These include NSAIDs like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and combination analgesics such as Excedrin Migraine. While package directions exist, your healthcare provider may recommend specific doses or combinations for migraine that differ from general pain relief; always consult them for appropriate dosing. Taking acute migraine medications too frequently (e.g., more than 2-3 days per week) can paradoxically lead to **medication overuse headache (MOH)**. It's vital to track your medication use and discuss this risk with your provider.

### Prescription Medications: Targeted Relief

When OTC options aren't sufficient, your doctor may prescribe more targeted medications.

*   **Triptans:** (e.g., sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, naratriptan, frovatriptan, eletriptan, almotriptan) are established for moderate to severe migraines. Available as oral tablets, ODTs, nasal sprays, and injectables, they constrict blood vessels and block pain pathways. Common side effects include tingling, flushing, chest tightness or pressure (usually not heart-related), and fatigue. Report any concerning symptoms to your doctor immediately.
*   **CGRP Receptor Antagonists (gepants):** Drugs like ubrogepant (Ubrelvy, FDA approved 2019) and rimegepant (Nurtec ODT, FDA approved 2020) are oral medications that block CGRP, a protein involved in migraine pain. They offer a non-triptan option, with Nurtec ODT also indicated for prevention. Common side effects include nausea and dry mouth.
*   **Serotonin 1F Receptor Agonists (ditans):** Lasmiditan (Reyvow, FDA approved 2019) targets serotonin receptors without causing vasoconstriction, making it an option for those with cardiovascular concerns. Common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, and fatigue. **Important:** Do not drive or operate machinery for at least 8 hours after taking Reyvow.

Newer medications (gepants, ditans) may be more expensive and often require insurance pre-authorization. Always check your insurance plan and discuss costs with your doctor or pharmacist.

### Practical Guidance for Your Journey

Finding the most effective treatment is often a process of trial and error, requiring close collaboration with your doctor.

*   **Migraine Diary:** Track:
    *   Time of migraine onset
    *   Severity (1-10 scale)
    *   Specific medications taken (dose, time)
    *   Time to medication effectiveness
    *   Level of pain relief
    *   Any side effects
    *   Overall treatment effectiveness
    *   Potential triggers
*   **Non-Pharmacological Strategies:** Complement medication with resting in a dark, quiet room; applying ice or heat packs; and using relaxation techniques or biofeedback.
*   **When to Seek Urgent Medical Care:** Seek immediate medical attention for "red flag" symptoms like the "worst headache of your life," a sudden severe headache, or headache accompanied by fever, stiff neck, rash, confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking.

Early intervention and a proactive approach are key to gaining control over your migraines.
