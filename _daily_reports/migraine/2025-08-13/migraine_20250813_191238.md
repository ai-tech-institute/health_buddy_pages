# Migraine: Acute Treatment Options for the Newly Diagnosed

Receiving a migraine diagnosis can be overwhelming. This summary clarifies acute treatment options—over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications—to empower you on your journey.

**Understanding Acute Treatment**

Acute treatments (abortive medications) are taken at the onset of a migraine attack to stop it or reduce severity. For maximum effectiveness, take them as early as possible, ideally within the first hour of symptoms.

**Over-the-Counter (OTC) Options**

Certain OTC options are specifically formulated for migraine, often combining ingredients for better efficacy:

*   **NSAIDs:** Ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin are effective for mild to moderate migraines. Caffeine can enhance their pain-relieving effects.
*   **Acetaminophen:** Often combined with aspirin and caffeine in specific migraine products (e.g., Excedrin Migraine), this combination is a common first-line OTC choice.

**Important Note on Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** Frequent OTC use can lead to MOH (rebound headache). To avoid this, limit combination OTC products to no more than 2-3 days per week, or 9 days per month. MOH can worsen and complicate migraine treatment. If OTCs aren't consistently effective, discuss prescription options.

**Prescription Medications: Targeted Relief**

When OTCs fall short, prescription medications offer more potent relief:

1.  **Triptans:** (e.g., Sumatriptan, Zolmitriptan, Rizatriptan) Often first-line for moderate to severe migraines, triptans constrict blood vessels and block pain pathways. Common side effects include "triptan sensation" (chest/neck/jaw tightness, tingling, warmth), dizziness, and fatigue. They are contraindicated for those with cardiovascular conditions like uncontrolled high blood pressure, history of heart attack/stroke, or peripheral artery disease.
2.  **CGRP Inhibitors (Geptants):** (e.g., Ubrogepant - Ubrelvy, Rimegepant - Nurtec ODT) Approved by the FDA in recent years, these non-triptan options specifically block the CGRP pathway, a key player in migraine pain. They are alternatives for those who can't tolerate triptans. Common side effects include nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue. Rimegepant (Nurtec ODT) can also be used preventatively.
3.  **Ditans:** (e.g., Lasmiditan - Reyvow) FDA-approved, this non-triptan class does not cause vasoconstriction, making it an option for those with cardiovascular concerns. Side effects include drowsiness, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and paresthesia. Driving is not recommended for at least 8 hours due to potential significant drowsiness.

**Practical Guidance for Newly Diagnosed:**

*   **Migraine Diary:** Track: date/time of onset, severity (1-10), symptoms (e.g., aura, throbbing pain, nausea, light/sound sensitivity), potential triggers, medication (name, dose, time), effectiveness, and side effects. This data is vital for your doctor.
*   **Early Intervention:** Taking medication at the earliest sign is key to success.
*   **Discuss Side Effects:** Be open with your doctor; finding the right fit may require trial and error.
*   **Prevention vs. Acute:** Acute medications treat an attack; preventive medications reduce frequency/severity. Your doctor might discuss both.
*   **When to Seek Emergency Care:** Contact your doctor or seek immediate medical attention for a "thunderclap headache" (sudden, severe headache), or any headache with: fever, stiff neck, rash, confusion, seizures, double vision, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. These could indicate a more serious condition.

Navigating migraine treatment requires partnering with your healthcare provider. Don't hesitate to ask questions and advocate for your needs.
