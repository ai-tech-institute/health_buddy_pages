## Multiple Sclerosis: Navigating Disease-Modifying Therapies (DMTs)

DMTs are crucial for managing MS, reducing relapses, slowing progression, and minimizing new lesions. Not cures, they offer personalized options by modulating the immune system.

**1. Injectable DMTs:**
*   **Interferon Betas** (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, Plegridy): (Approved from 1996 for RRMS/some SPMS). Reduce inflammation. Subcutaneous/intramuscular. Common: flu-like symptoms. Monitor liver enzymes; report persistent fever/fatigue.
*   **Glatiramer Acetate** (Copaxone, Glatopa): (Approved 1996 for RRMS). Mimics myelin. Subcutaneous. Common: injection site reactions. Report transient chest tightness.

**2. Oral DMTs:**
*   **S1P Receptor Modulators** (fingolimod (Gilenya, 2010), siponimod (Mayzent, 2019), ozanimod (Zeposia, 2020), ponesimod (Ponvory, 2021)): For RRMS/active SPMS. Trap immune cells. Fingolimod requires first-dose cardiac observation. All need regular ophthalmologic exams for macular edema. Report blurred vision/slow heart rate.
*   **Fumarates** (dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, 2013), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity, 2019)): For RRMS. Reduce inflammation. Common: flushing, GI issues. Regular lymphocyte blood tests critical. Severe lymphopenia increases rare PML risk; report cognitive changes.
*   **Teriflunomide** (Aubagio, 2012): For RRMS. Inhibits immune cells. **Teratogenic:** Strict contraception for men/women, requires "washout" before conception. Monitor liver function; report yellow skin.
*   **Cladribine** (Mavenclad, 2019): For RRMS/active SPMS, highly active disease. Two courses. Reduces lymphocytes. Increased malignancy risk; requires cancer screenings. Report unusual lumps.

**3. Infusion/Subcutaneous DMTs:**
*   **Natalizumab** (Tysabri, 2004): For RRMS. Prevents immune cells crossing blood-brain barrier. High PML risk if JCV positive. Regular JCV antibody testing crucial. Report new neurological symptoms.
*   **Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibodies** (ocrelizumab (Ocrevus, 2017 for RRMS/PPMS), **ofatumumab (Kesimpta, 2020 for RRMS/active SPMS, subcutaneous)**): Target B-cells. Ocrelizumab infused. Increased infection risk. Report fever/chills.
*   **Alemtuzumab** (Lemtrada, 2014): For RRMS, often for failed therapies. Depletes immune cells. Under rigorous REMS. **Intensive, multi-year monitoring** for secondary autoimmune conditions (thyroid, ITP, kidney) and infections. Report fatigue, weight changes, easy bruising.

**Practical Guidance:**
Shared decision with your neurologist. Ask:
*   "Monitoring schedule (tests, frequency)?"
*   "Specific serious side effects to report immediately?"
*   "DMT impact on family planning/pregnancy?"
*   "Lifestyle adjustments needed?"
*   "Managing common side effects?"

**Understanding Your Results:**
*   **MRI:** "New lesions" (active disease), "lesion burden" (total damage) track efficacy.
*   **Blood Work:** "Lymphocyte counts" (immune cell levels, infection/PML risk); "liver enzymes" (liver health). Abnormalities may alter treatment.

**Adherence & Escalation:**
Consistent adherence is vital. Learn proper administration. If disease activity persists, discuss "treatment escalation" or "switching DMTs." MS management is dynamic; open communication is key.
