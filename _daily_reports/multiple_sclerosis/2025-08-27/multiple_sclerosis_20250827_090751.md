# Multiple Sclerosis: Navigating Personalized DMT Selection

For individuals with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), choosing a Disease-Modifying Therapy (DMT) is a critical, personalized decision. The evolving treatment landscape emphasizes individualized care, balancing a drug's efficacy, its specific risks, patient health, and lifestyle. This empowers you to actively participate in your treatment plan.

**Personalized DMTs: Beyond One-Size-Fits-All**

Research shows that "highly active MS"—meaning frequent relapses, significant new MRI lesions, or worsening disability—often benefits from "high-efficacy" DMTs early on. These newer therapies, unlike "older, platform therapies" such as **Interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif)** or **Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone)**, offer superior effectiveness.

When evaluating DMTs, focus on:
*   **Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR) reduction:** How much the drug lowers the number of relapses.
*   **MRI lesion activity:** Reduction in new T2 or gadolinium-enhancing lesions.
*   **Disability progression:** Measured by the **Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)**, a 0-10 neurological scale where higher numbers indicate greater disability in functions like walking, balance, and vision.
