# Multiple Myeloma: Prioritizing Bone Health – Preventing and Managing Fractures

A Multiple Myeloma diagnosis can be overwhelming, but understanding its impact on your bones is crucial. Myeloma often weakens bones, causes pain, and increases fracture risk. Proactive bone health management is key to your treatment, preventing complications and improving quality of life.

## Myeloma's Impact on Bones

Myeloma disrupts bone remodeling. Imagine your bones are constantly being rebuilt, but myeloma acts like a wrecking ball, breaking down more bone than is being built back up. This imbalance leads to "lytic lesions" – areas of bone destruction – making bones fragile, especially in the spine, ribs, and pelvis.

## Comprehensive Bone Assessment

Advocate for a thorough bone assessment. Beyond X-rays, discuss:
*   **Whole-body low-dose CT (WBLDCT):** More sensitive than X-rays for detecting lytic lesions.
*   **MRI:** Excellent for bone marrow involvement and identifying impending fractures.
*   **PET/CT:** Identifies active myeloma lesions and assesses treatment response.
Discuss the *expected frequency* of these scans with your care team.

Monitor blood tests for **calcium levels**. Myeloma can cause high calcium (hypercalcemia), leading to fatigue, confusion, excessive thirst, or constipation – report these symptoms immediately. **Alkaline phosphatase**, a bone formation marker, is typically *not* elevated in myeloma bone disease, which is a distinctive diagnostic clue.

## Key Strategies for Fracture Prevention

### 1. Bone-Strengthening Medications
These are critical to protect your bones:
*   **Bisphosphonates (e.g., Zoledronic Acid (Zometa), Pamidronate (Aredia)):** FDA-approved to prevent skeletal-related events and manage hypercalcemia. Given intravenously, they slow bone breakdown. Common side effects include flu-like symptoms, kidney considerations (stay hydrated!), and bone/joint/muscle pain. **Critical dental care:** Optimize dental health *before* starting. Avoid invasive procedures (extractions, implants) *while on* bisphosphonates; discuss a "drug holiday" with your oncologist and dentist if unavoidable.
*   **Denosumab (Xgeva):** FDA-approved for preventing skeletal-related events. Administered via subcutaneous injection, it's an alternative, especially for kidney impairment. Common side effects include back pain, joint pain, fatigue, and importantly, **hypocalcemia (low calcium)**, requiring regular calcium and Vitamin D supplementation. Denosumab also carries an ONJ risk, requiring the same diligent dental care as bisphosphonates.

### 2. Nutritional Support
Ensure adequate **Calcium (1000-1200 mg daily)** and **Vitamin D (at least 800-1000 IU daily)**. *Check your Vitamin D levels* with your doctor, as many myeloma patients are deficient and may need higher initial doses. Good sources: dairy, fortified plant milks, leafy greens (Calcium); fatty fish, fortified cereals (Vitamin D).

### 3. Safe Movement and Exercise
Under medical guidance, **weight-bearing exercises** like walking can strengthen bones. *Avoid activities that involve twisting the spine, heavy lifting, or high-impact movements*, especially with spinal lesions. Discuss *any* new exercise routine with your care team *before* starting.

## Managing Existing Fractures and Pain

If a fracture occurs, pain management is paramount. This can involve pain medications (e.g., NSAIDs, opioids, neuropathic pain medications), nerve blocks, or procedures like **vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty** for spinal compression fractures. These inject bone cement to stabilize vertebrae and relieve pain. Discuss options and potential risks (e.g., cement leakage, infection) with your oncologist and pain specialist.

## Practical Advice for New Patients

*   **Communicate dental issues immediately:** Before starting bone-targeting agents.
*   **Report new pain:** Don't dismiss new or worsening bone pain.
*   **Discuss weight-bearing restrictions:** Understand your specific limitations.
*   **Regular monitoring:** Your bone health will be continuously monitored.
*   **Fall prevention:** Clear pathways at home, ensure good lighting, use assistive devices if needed, and wear supportive, low-heeled shoes, especially if other treatments cause neuropathy or weakness.

Proactive bone health management is an ongoing journey. Understanding risks, utilizing medications, and adopting supportive lifestyle changes can significantly reduce complications and maintain a better quality of life.
