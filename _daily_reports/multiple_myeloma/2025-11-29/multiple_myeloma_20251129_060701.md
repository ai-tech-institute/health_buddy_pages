# Multiple Myeloma: Protecting Your Bones and Preventing Fractures

Living with Multiple Myeloma means prioritizing bone health to prevent painful fractures. This summary provides informed patients with actionable strategies for proactive bone management.

Multiple Myeloma often weakens bones, increasing fracture risk and causing pain. This happens because myeloma cells disrupt the natural balance of bone formation and breakdown. Understanding this helps you appreciate why certain treatments are vital.

### Bone-Strengthening Medications

**Bisphosphonates** (e.g., zoledronic acid/Zometa, pamidronate/Aredia) are FDA-approved intravenous drugs that strengthen bones by slowing down bone breakdown. They are typically administered monthly or every 3-4 weeks initially. A key risk is osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). **Before starting**, a comprehensive dental evaluation is crucial. While on treatment, avoid invasive dental procedures like extractions. Report any jaw pain or exposed bone immediately. Kidney function tests are also essential.

**Denosumab** (e.g., Xgeva), also FDA-approved, is a subcutaneous injection, usually given every 4 weeks. It works differently from bisphosphonates and can be an option, especially for those with kidney impairment. Like bisphosphonates, ONJ is a risk, requiring excellent oral hygiene and immediate reporting of jaw symptoms.

### Early Detection: Advanced Imaging

Beyond X-rays, **advanced imaging** like Whole-Body Low-Dose CT (WBLDCT), MRI, and PET/CT are used to detect subtle bone lesions. These scans vary in duration (30-90 minutes) and may require contrast or specific preparation (e.g., fasting for PET/CT). Ask your oncologist: "What do these results mean for my fracture risk?" and "How will these findings influence my treatment plan?"

### Supportive Care for Stronger Bones

*   **Vitamin D & Calcium:** Aim for Vitamin D levels above 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) and a daily calcium intake of 1000-1200 mg (from diet and supplements, if needed). Your doctor will individualize dosages based on blood tests.
*   **Physical Therapy:** A physical therapist experienced in oncology or bone health can help. Safe exercises include gentle stretching, balance training, and appropriate weight-bearing activities. **Avoid** high-impact activities or spinal flexion exercises, especially with vertebral lesions.

### Understanding Your Reports

*   **DEXA Scans:** Measure bone mineral density. A T-score of -1.0 or higher is generally considered normal. While useful, myeloma-related bone disease differs from typical osteoporosis. Ask your doctor: "How do my DEXA results influence my fracture risk given my myeloma?"
*   **Bone Turnover Markers:** Blood tests like N-telopeptide (NTX) and C-telopeptide (CTX) can indicate bone metabolism. High levels *generally* suggest increased bone breakdown, while lower levels *might* indicate treatment effectiveness. Your care team interprets these complex markers.

### Future Horizons & Clinical Trials

New therapies, such as sclerostin inhibitors and anti-DKK1 antibodies, are being investigated to further protect and repair bones. To explore clinical trials, visit ClinicalTrials.gov or myeloma foundation websites. Ask your care team: "Am I eligible for any bone-focused clinical trials?" and "What are the potential benefits and risks?"

Proactive communication with your multidisciplinary team—including oncologists, radiologists, and dentists—is key to optimizing bone health and maintaining your quality of life.
