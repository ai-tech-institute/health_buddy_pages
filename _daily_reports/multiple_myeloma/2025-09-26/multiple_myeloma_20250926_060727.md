# Multiple Myeloma: Managing Hypercalcemia and Kidney Health

For newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma patients, understanding potential complications like hypercalcemia (high calcium) and kidney issues is vital. Proactive management can significantly improve treatment outcomes and quality of life.

### Understanding Hypercalcemia

Multiple myeloma can cause bone breakdown, releasing excessive calcium into the bloodstream. This condition, hypercalcemia, can lead to fatigue, confusion, excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation, and muscle weakness. Untreated, severe hypercalcemia can cause kidney damage, heart rhythm problems, coma, and even be life-threatening.

**What to watch for:** Persistent changes in energy, mental clarity, or bowel habits.
**Practical Guidance:** Your doctor will monitor **serum calcium** levels. Normal is typically 8.5-10.2 mg/dL. Levels above 12 mg/dL are concerning. Always ask your care team about your specific numbers.

### Protecting Your Kidneys

Myeloma can harm kidneys through abnormal proteins and hypercalcemia. **M-proteins** (monoclonal proteins) are produced by myeloma cells; **Bence Jones proteins** are light chains of M-proteins found in urine. Their presence signifies potential kidney damage.

**Key Indicators & Monitoring:** Regular blood tests check **creatinine** and **blood urea nitrogen (BUN)**. More importantly, **estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)** indicates kidney filtering capacity. Healthy eGFR is usually ≥90 mL/min/1.73 m². A declining eGFR (e.g., 60-89 indicates mild decline, 30-59 moderate) warrants close attention. Urine tests also screen for abnormal proteins.

**Practical Guidance:**
*   **Stay Hydrated:** Drink 8-10 glasses of water daily, unless advised otherwise. This helps kidneys flush waste and mitigates hypercalcemia.
*   **Medication Awareness:** Discuss all medications, including OTCs and supplements, with your oncologist as some can impact kidney function.
*   **Dietary Support:** If kidney function declines, your doctor or a renal dietitian may recommend limiting sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Always consult your medical team before making dietary changes.
*   **Early Intervention:** Treatments include hydration and bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid, pamidronate), FDA-approved for hypercalcemia of malignancy, typically given intravenously. Side effects can include flu-like symptoms, jaw osteonecrosis (ONJ - rare, but emphasizes good oral hygiene), and potential kidney toxicity. Newer myeloma therapies can be kidney-friendly. Daratumumab and carfilzomib are primary myeloma treatments (FDA-approved for specific lines of therapy/progression) that can also improve kidney function. Common side effects vary but can include infusion reactions, infections (daratumumab), and heart issues (carfilzomib). Discuss all potential side effects with your team.

### Proactive Steps for Patients

Be proactive. Ask your team about your specific calcium and kidney numbers, normal ranges, and the plan if levels are abnormal. **Report any new or worsening symptoms immediately,** as early detection and management significantly impact your treatment journey and well-being.
