# Multiple Myeloma: Proactive Management of Kidney and Bone Health

For individuals living with Multiple Myeloma, managing kidney complications and maintaining bone strength are critical for quality of life and treatment outcomes. Beyond general awareness, understanding specific details and proactive strategies empowers patients and their loved ones.

## Protecting Your Kidneys

Multiple Myeloma can directly harm kidneys through abnormal protein accumulation. While creatinine is monitored, your **estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)** provides a more accurate picture of kidney function. A declining eGFR, or increasing **urine protein/albumin ratios**, warrants immediate discussion with your hematologist and nephrologist.

**Hydration** is vital to flush out harmful proteins. Always inform your care team about your myeloma status before any new procedures or prescriptions, as some imaging contrasts or medications can be nephrotoxic. Early, aggressive myeloma treatment with **proteasome inhibitors** like **bortezomib (Velcade)** and **carfilzomib (Kyprolis)**—both FDA-approved for multiple myeloma—can often reverse kidney damage. Be aware of potential side effects: bortezomib can cause neuropathy, and carfilzomib may lead to cardiac or pulmonary issues.

## Fortifying Your Bones

Myeloma cells disrupt bone remodeling, leading to pain, fractures, and hypercalcemia. **Bone-modifying agents (BMAs)** are paramount. These drugs prevent **skeletal-related events (SREs)**, which include pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and the need for bone radiation or surgery.

*   **Bisphosphonates:** **Zoledronic acid (Zometa)** and **pamidronate (Aredia)** are FDA-approved and typically given as monthly IV infusions. Common side effects include flu-like symptoms and potential kidney toxicity (requiring monitoring). Rarely, atypical femoral fractures can occur. They are contraindicated in uncorrected hypocalcemia.
*   **Denosumab (Xgeva):** Also FDA-approved, this is a monthly subcutaneous injection often preferred for patients with kidney impairment. Side effects include hypocalcemia (requiring calcium/Vitamin D supplementation and monitoring), fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. It's also contraindicated in uncorrected hypocalcemia.

Discuss **osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ)** with your dental and oncology teams. Excellent oral hygiene and completing necessary dental work *before* starting BMAs significantly reduce this rare but serious risk.

Beyond supplements, medically cleared **weight-bearing exercise** and dietary calcium/Vitamin D (e.g., dairy, leafy greens, fatty fish) support bone health. Track your **serum calcium** and **Vitamin D levels**, and discuss the frequency of **DEXA scans** with your team.

## Proactive Questions for Your Care Team:

*   What are my specific kidney function metrics (eGFR, creatinine, urine protein/albumin ratio), and what trends should I watch for?
*   Which bone-modifying agent is best for my situation, considering my kidney function?
*   What dental clearance is needed *before* starting BMAs?
*   What symptoms of ONJ or hypocalcemia should I report immediately?

Understanding these detailed aspects empowers you to be a more informed and proactive participant in your myeloma care, leading to better outcomes and an enhanced quality of life.
