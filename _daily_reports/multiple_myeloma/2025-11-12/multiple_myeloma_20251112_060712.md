# Monitoring Your Myeloma: What Lab Values and Symptoms to Watch For

Vigilant monitoring of lab values and symptoms is paramount for managing Multiple Myeloma, understanding treatment efficacy, and detecting progression or complications early. As an informed patient, understanding these indicators empowers you to actively participate in your care.

## Key Lab Values and What They Mean

*   **M-Protein (SPEP, UPEP, SFLC):** The hallmark of myeloma. A sudden, substantial increase (e.g., >25% or >0.5 g/dL) in M-protein or kappa/lambda ratio often signals disease activity. If you observe such a rise, contact your care team, especially if accompanied by new symptoms.
*   **Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M):** A prognostic marker tracked regularly. Rising levels can indicate increased disease activity or progression.
*   **Calcium Levels:** Myeloma can cause hypercalcemia. A normal range is typically 8.5-10.2 mg/dL; levels above 10.5 mg/dL are concerning. Severe symptoms like confusion or extreme thirst require immediate medical contact.
*   **Creatinine:** Measures kidney function. A significant increase above your baseline or above 1.2 mg/dL is concerning. Sharp increases warrant immediate action. Stay well-hydrated to support kidney health.
*   **Complete Blood Count (CBC):** Myeloma suppresses healthy blood cell production.
    *   **Anemia:** Hemoglobin below 8-9 g/dL.
    *   **Thrombocytopenia:** Platelets below 50,000.
    *   **Leukopenia:** Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) below 1,000. Report any fever over 100.4°F immediately to your care team due to infection risk.
*   **Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH):** Elevated LDH can indicate rapid cell turnover and may be associated with more aggressive disease, influencing treatment decisions. It's monitored for all patients.

## Practical Guidance: Reading Your Reports

Always request and keep copies of all your lab reports (physical or digital). Organize them for easy trend analysis. Focus on trends over time and discuss all results with your oncologist.

## Symptoms to Actively Monitor

Beyond the "CRAB" criteria (Calcium elevation, Renal failure, Anemia, Bone lesions), be attuned to more subtle changes.
*   **Persistent or Worsening Fatigue / Unexplained Weight Loss:** Discuss at your next appointment unless severe and sudden.
*   **Recurrent Infections:** Fever over 100.4°F or signs of infection require an immediate call to your care team.
*   **New or Worsening Pain:** Especially sudden, severe bone pain should prompt an immediate call.
*   **Neurological Changes:** Numbness, tingling, weakness, nerve pain, or Peripheral Neuropathy (a common side effect of treatments like bortezomib or thalidomide) requires careful monitoring. Report significant changes promptly.
*   **Signs of Blood Clots:** Myeloma and treatments increase clotting risk. Sudden swelling, pain, or redness in a limb, or sudden shortness of breath and chest pain require immediate medical attention.

## Empowering Yourself

Understand your specific myeloma subtype (e.g., light chain only, non-secretory, high-risk cytogenetics), as this impacts monitoring. Maintain a detailed symptom diary (notebook, app, or template). Bring a written list of questions to every appointment. Remember, imaging studies (X-rays, MRI, PET/CT scans) are also critical monitoring tools for bone health and disease burden. Proactive communication is your strongest tool.
