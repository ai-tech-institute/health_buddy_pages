# Type 2 Diabetes: A Caretaker's Essential Guide to Blood Sugar Extremes

For primary caretakers of individuals with Type 2 diabetes, understanding and managing blood sugar extremes—hypoglycemia (low) and hyperglycemia (high)—is critical for well-being and preventing serious complications.

### Recognizing & Treating Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

Hypoglycemia (blood glucose below 70 mg/dL) can manifest as shakiness, sweating, hunger, or subtle changes like confusion, irritability, or mood swings. Severe cases may lead to seizures or unconsciousness.

**Immediate Treatment (The Rule of 15):** Give 15 grams of a fast-acting carbohydrate (e.g., 4 oz juice/regular soda, 3-4 glucose tablets). Recheck blood sugar in 15 minutes; repeat if still low. Once stable, offer a small protein snack.

**Emergency Glucagon:** For severe hypoglycemia where the individual is unconscious or unable to swallow, emergency glucagon (nasal spray or injectable pen) is life-saving. Ensure you have a prescription, it's readily accessible, and you're trained *before* an emergency. **If glucagon is administered and there's no improvement, or the person remains unconscious, call 911 immediately.**

**Prevention:** Ensure consistent meal times (avoid skipping meals), adhere to medication schedules, and monitor blood sugar around physical activity. Understand which medications (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas) increase hypoglycemia risk.

### Recognizing & Treating Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)

Hyperglycemia (blood sugar above target, often >180 mg/dL) can be caused by missed medication, illness, stress, or diet. Symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, or recurrent infections.

**Immediate Treatment:** Encourage increased water intake. If blood sugar is consistently above 250 mg/dL, especially during illness, check for ketones. Moderate to high ketones with high blood sugar warrant immediate contact with a healthcare provider, as this could indicate diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).

**When to Contact Healthcare:** Contact the healthcare team if blood sugar remains consistently above 250-300 mg/dL for several hours, even without ketones, despite increased fluid intake and medication adherence. This may require medical adjustment to prevent DKA.

**Prevention:** Strict medication adherence, following dietary recommendations, stress management, and regular blood sugar monitoring (especially during illness) are key.

### Practical Guidance & Monitoring

**Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs):** CGMs offer real-time blood sugar readings, reducing finger pricks and providing alerts for trends. These devices require a prescription, and insurance coverage varies. Discuss access with the medical team.

**Understanding Blood Work & Targets:** Blood sugar targets are personalized, but typical ranges are: Fasting: 80-130 mg/dL, Post-meal: under 180 mg/dL, HbA1c: typically below 7%. Discuss your loved one's specific goals with their doctor.

**Emergency Preparedness:** Create a written emergency plan with your healthcare team. This plan should include contact numbers, a current medication list, and step-by-step instructions for managing both hypo- and hyperglycemia. Share this plan with family, schools, or workplaces.

Empowering caretakers with this knowledge fosters a safer and more stable environment for individuals managing Type 2 diabetes, significantly improving their quality of life.
