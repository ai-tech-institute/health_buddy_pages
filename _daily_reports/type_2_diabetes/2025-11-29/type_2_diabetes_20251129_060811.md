# Type 2 Diabetes: Deciphering Your Lab Results – A1C, Cholesterol, and Kidney Function

Understanding your lab results is crucial for managing Type 2 diabetes. This summary provides insights into key markers—A1C, cholesterol, and kidney function—empowering you to actively partner with your healthcare team.

## A1C: Beyond the Average Blood Sugar

The A1C test shows your average blood sugar over 2-3 months. While <7% is a common target, your *individualized* goal is paramount; some, like older adults, may aim higher (e.g., 7.5-8%) to prevent dangerous lows. Beyond the average, "glucose variability" (swings between high and low blood sugar) is also important. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices offer detailed insights into these fluctuations. To explore CGM, discuss it with your endocrinologist or primary care physician and contact your insurance provider about coverage criteria for Type 2 diabetes.

## Cholesterol: Beyond Good and Bad

Look beyond just LDL and HDL to your *non-HDL cholesterol* (target <130 mg/dL for Type 2 diabetes) and *triglyceride* levels (elevated above 150 mg/dL indicates increased cardiovascular risk). Lifestyle changes, like reducing refined carbohydrates, can significantly lower triglycerides. For some, icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), an FDA-approved prescription omega-3, reduces cardiovascular events. It's typically for patients with elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) despite statin therapy, who have established cardiovascular disease or diabetes with additional risk factors. Potential side effects include joint pain, swelling, and atrial fibrillation. Discuss if it's right for you.

## Kidney Function: Early Detection is Key

Diabetes is a leading cause of kidney disease. Your lab report will include **eGFR** (estimates kidney filtering, healthy ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and **Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR)**. Elevated UACR (microalbuminuria, 30-300 mg/g) is an early sign of kidney damage, often before eGFR drops.

If UACR is elevated, your doctor might recommend medications like SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., Farxiga, Jardiance) or GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., Ozempic, Trulicity). These are FDA-approved for kidney protection in Type 2 diabetes, slowing disease progression. Eligibility often depends on eGFR and UACR levels. SGLT2 inhibitors can cause genital yeast infections or dehydration. GLP-1 agonists may lead to gastrointestinal issues (nausea, vomiting). Regular monitoring of both eGFR and UACR, at least annually, is crucial for early intervention.
