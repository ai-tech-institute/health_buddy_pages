# Type 2 Diabetes: Advanced Strategies for Proactive Kidney, Eye, and Nerve Health Management

For informed patients with Type 2 diabetes, proactive management of complications is paramount. Beyond blood sugar control, emerging strategies protect your kidneys, eyes, and nerves. Track your blood glucose, blood pressure, and any new symptoms for valuable discussions with your healthcare team.

## Kidney Health: Beyond Microalbuminuria

Monitor your eGFR (ideally >60 mL/min/1.73m²) and UACR (aim for <30 mg/g). A UACR >30 mg/g or a sustained eGFR drop (>30% from baseline, or <60 mL/min/1.73m² for 3+ months) warrants attention. These tests are typically annual, more often if concerns arise.

FDA-approved SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide) offer significant kidney protection. SGLT2i side effects include genitourinary infections, dehydration, with eGFR cutoffs (e.g., >20-30 mL/min/1.73m²). GLP-1 RAs may cause nausea/vomiting. Both benefit patients with existing CKD (eGFR >20-30 mL/min/1.73m²) or cardiovascular disease, even with good A1C. Ask your doctor: "Am I a candidate for these for kidney protection?" or "What are my eGFR/UACR targets and testing frequency?"

## Eye Health: Advanced Retinal Screening and Novel Treatments

Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of blindness. FDA-approved AI-powered retinal screening systems are increasing access to rapid assessments in specialized clinics. For diabetic macular edema (DME) or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), FDA-approved anti-VEGF injections (ranibizumab, aflibercept, faricimab) revolutionize treatment. Injections are quick, in-office procedures after local anesthetic. Mild side effects include temporary blurred vision or eye irritation; infection risk is low. Faricimab may reduce injection frequency. Regular follow-up with a retina specialist, often every 4-8 weeks initially, is crucial.

## Nerve Health: Early Detection and Symptom Management

Report any new numbness, tingling, burning, sharp pains, loss of sensation (especially in feet), balance issues, or muscle weakness. Daily foot checks are vital. Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) and nerve conduction studies can confirm diagnosis or assess severity.

Beyond intensive blood glucose control, FDA-approved gabapentin and pregabalin manage painful diabetic neuropathy. Side effects include dizziness, drowsiness; use caution when driving. Meticulous foot care, including daily inspection, proper footwear, and regular podiatrist visits, is essential to prevent ulcers.

In summary, staying informed about advanced diagnostics, kidney-protective medications, eye treatments, and early neuropathy management can significantly enhance your long-term health and quality of life.
