# Type 2 Diabetes: Your Guide to Preventing Foot Complications

Being newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes means learning how to protect your feet is vital. Diabetes can damage your nerves (neuropathy), causing numbness or pain, and narrow your blood vessels (peripheral artery disease), reducing blood flow. Both make your feet vulnerable. Consistent care can prevent serious issues and ensure your well-being.

## Essential Daily Foot Care

Daily foot care is your first defense; it's about vigilance.
*   **Inspect Daily:** Look for cuts, blisters, redness, or swelling. Use a mirror for soles and between toes, or ask a loved one to help check commonly missed areas.
*   **Wash Daily:** Use lukewarm water and mild soap. Dry thoroughly, especially between toes, to prevent fungal infections. Avoid soaking your feet.
*   **Moisturize Carefully:** Apply fragrance-free, non-greasy lotion (avoiding alcohol-based products) to keep skin soft, but *never* between toes. This prevents excess moisture that can lead to fungal growth.
*   **Trim Toenails Straight:** Cut nails straight across, not too short, and file sharp edges. Avoid cutting corners to prevent ingrown nails. If you have vision issues, nerve damage, or thick nails, professional help is crucial. Cutting them yourself risks accidental cuts, infections, or ingrown nails due to poor sensation or healing.
*   **Choose Proper Footwear:** Always wear comfortable, well-fitting shoes and seamless, moisture-wicking diabetic socks. Avoid going barefoot. Try on shoes at the end of the day when feet are slightly swollen, ensure a thumb's width between your longest toe and the shoe's end, and look for supportive shoes with a wide toe box. Diabetic socks prevent constriction, reduce friction, and keep feet dry, warding off infections.

## Understanding Risks & Prevention

Nerve damage can numb your feet, so you might not feel a small wound until it's severe. Poor circulation slows healing, turning minor issues into serious ulcers. Even a small pebble in your shoe can escalate quickly. Remember, consistently high blood sugar levels cause this nerve and circulation damage, so managing your diabetes treatment plan is key to foot health.

## When to Seek a Podiatrist

Regular podiatrist check-ups are vital. You should see one at least once a year, or more often if advised. Ask your primary doctor for a referral, look for DPM credentials, and confirm they specialize in diabetic foot care.

**Seek immediate professional attention if you notice:**
*   A cut, blister, or sore that doesn't heal within a few days.
*   Signs of infection: redness, warmth, swelling, pus, or fever.
*   Changes in skin color, temperature, numbness, tingling, or pain.
*   New calluses, corns, bunions, or any foul odor.

While waiting for an appointment, keep the area clean and dry, avoid self-treating with home remedies, do not pick at wounds or blisters, and elevate your foot if swollen.

During a comprehensive foot exam, expect checks for sensation (with a monofilament), blood flow (pulses), skin and nail changes, and footwear evaluation. Consistent daily care and regular podiatrist visits dramatically reduce the risk of severe complications like infections, ulcers, and amputation. Your podiatrist is a critical member of your diabetes care team, helping you maintain healthy feet for life.
