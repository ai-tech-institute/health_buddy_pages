# Managing Type 2 Diabetes on Sick Days: A Caregiver's Essential Guide

For caregivers of individuals with Type 2 diabetes, managing sick days requires a clear action plan. Illness, even a common cold, raises stress hormones, increasing blood sugar and complicating management. Proactive care significantly improves safety and outcomes.

**1. Create a Personalized Sick Day Plan (BEFORE Illness Strikes):**
Work with the healthcare team to develop a written plan detailing:
*   Specific medication adjustments (e.g., insulin dose changes, which oral meds to pause).
*   Blood sugar and ketone monitoring frequency.
*   Fluid and food intake targets.
*   Clear "when to call the doctor" criteria.

**2. Key Monitoring & Warning Signs:**
*   **Blood Sugar:** Check every 2-4 hours. For CGM users, set alerts for rapid changes (e.g., >50 mg/dL/hour rise or sustained levels >250 mg/dL for 2+ hours) and follow your plan's immediate steps.
*   **Ketone Testing:** If blood sugar is consistently >240 mg/dL, test for ketones.
    *   **Urine Strips:** Dip strip, compare color to chart. "Small" (light pink/purple) means increased fluids; "Moderate" or "Large" (darker purple) requires immediate medical contact.
    *   **Blood Ketone Meters:** Provides a numerical reading. Levels >0.6 mmol/L may indicate a problem; >1.5 mmol/L is moderate, >3.0 mmol/L is high and requires urgent medical attention.
*   **Temperature:** Monitor for fever, which impacts blood sugar.
*   **Dehydration:** Watch for dry mouth, decreased urination, extreme thirst.

**3. Medication Adjustments & Fluid/Food Intake:**
*   **Medications:** Never stop insulin or diabetes medications without professional advice.
    *   **Insulin:** Doses may need *increasing* to combat high blood sugar from illness.
    *   **Oral Medications:** Some, like SGLT2 inhibitors (e.g., empagliflozin, dapagliflozin) may increase DKA risk and need pausing. Metformin might need pausing due to lactic acidosis risk with dehydration. Consult the doctor.
*   **Fluid Intake:** Paramount to prevent dehydration. Offer 8 ounces of sugar-free fluids (water, broth, diet soda) every hour.
*   **Nutrition on Sick Days:** If tolerating solids, offer easily digestible carbohydrates like crackers, toast, plain soup, or applesauce. Reintroduce regular meals as symptoms improve.

**4. Managing Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar) on Sick Days:**
If blood sugar drops below 70 mg/dL:
*   Administer 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., 4 ounces fruit juice or regular soda, 3-4 glucose tablets).
*   Recheck blood sugar after 15 minutes. Repeat if still low.

**5. When to Call the Healthcare Team:**
Have this information ready:
*   Current blood sugar and ketone levels.
*   Specific symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, fever, pain).
*   Temperature.
*   Fluid intake over the last few hours.
*   Complete list of current medications and last doses taken.

**6. When to Call 911 or Go to the Emergency Room:**
Seek immediate emergency care for:
*   Persistent vomiting or inability to keep down fluids for >4-6 hours.
*   Blood sugar consistently >300 mg/dL despite sick day rules.
*   Moderate to large ketones.
*   Signs of severe dehydration.
*   Difficulty breathing, deep rapid breathing (Kussmaul respirations).
*   Confusion or disorientation.
