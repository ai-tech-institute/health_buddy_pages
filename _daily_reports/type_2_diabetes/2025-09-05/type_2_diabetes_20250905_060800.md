# Type 2 Diabetes: Move More, Live Better – Your Guide to Physical Activity

A Type 2 diabetes diagnosis is a call to action for your health. Physical activity is a powerful tool, but **always consult your doctor or healthcare team BEFORE starting any new exercise program.** They can ensure it's safe for your specific health status and help prevent complications.

Even small, consistent movement makes a significant difference. Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, helps manage blood sugar, supports weight management, and boosts overall well-being. Any movement is better than none!

**Recommended Activity Guidelines:**
Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week (like brisk walking), spread over at least 3 days, with no more than 2 consecutive days without activity. Also, incorporate strength training 2-3 times per week, along with flexibility exercises.

**Practical Tips for Daily Movement:**

*   **Activity Snacks:** Break movement into 5-10 minute segments. Take the stairs, march during commercials, or walk during breaks. Short bursts add up!
*   **Find Your Joy:** Choose activities you genuinely enjoy – dancing, gardening, walking with a friend. Enjoyment leads to consistency.
*   **Start Small, Build Gradually:** Begin comfortably and slowly increase duration or intensity to minimize injury and build confidence.
*   **Integrate into Routine:** Walk for short errands, do calf raises while waiting, or take a post-meal stroll. Make movement a natural part of your day.
*   **Hydration & Footwear:** Stay well-hydrated. Invest in comfortable, supportive shoes to prevent discomfort.
*   **Consult Professionals:** If you have limitations or need personalized guidance, consider a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) or physical therapist.

**Managing Blood Sugar and Activity:**

*   **Check Blood Sugar:** Check before, during (for longer sessions), and after exercise. This helps you understand how activity impacts your levels.
*   **Safe Levels:** Generally, exercise is safe when blood sugar is between 100-250 mg/dL. Discuss specific targets with your doctor.
*   **Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar):** Watch for shakiness, sweating, dizziness, confusion. If symptoms occur, stop activity and treat immediately with 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., glucose tablets, fruit juice). Recheck in 15 minutes.
*   **When to Avoid:** If blood sugar is very high (above 250 mg/dL, especially with ketones, or above 300 mg/dL without ketones), avoid intense exercise and consult your doctor.
*   **Medication Impact:** Physical activity can affect medication dosages, particularly insulin or certain oral medications. Always discuss your activity plans with your doctor to prevent blood sugar fluctuations.

**Set Realistic Goals & Track Progress:**
Work with your healthcare team to set achievable goals. Track not just steps or duration, but also how activity affects your blood sugar. Seeing these patterns can be incredibly empowering and help you adjust your plan.

**Listen to Your Body:**
Differentiate muscle soreness from pain. Stop immediately and seek medical attention for chest pain, severe dizziness, unusual shortness of breath, or any concerning symptoms.

By adopting these tips, you're not just managing Type 2 diabetes; you're actively taking charge of your health journey and enhancing your quality of life.
