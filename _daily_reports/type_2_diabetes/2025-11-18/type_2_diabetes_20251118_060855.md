# Understanding Your Type 2 Diabetes Medications: Metformin, SGLT2i, GLP-1s, and More

Navigating Type 2 diabetes medications can be complex. Beyond blood sugar control, modern treatments offer vital additional health benefits. Understanding your options is key to informed, personalized care.

### Metformin: The Foundation

Metformin reduces liver glucose production and improves insulin sensitivity. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, often eased by taking it with food. Long-term use can lead to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Discuss regular B12 level checks with your doctor, especially if you experience numbness, tingling (neuropathy), or fatigue. Monitoring annually or as advised is important.

### SGLT2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i): Organ Protection

Drugs like empagliflozin (Jardiance) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga) prompt kidneys to remove excess glucose via urine. Crucially, SGLT2i's offer substantial **cardiovascular and kidney protection**, reducing heart failure risk and slowing kidney disease progression. Be aware of potential urinary tract (burning, frequent urination) and yeast infections (unusual discharge/itching). Staying hydrated, typically 8-10 glasses of water daily (unless medically advised otherwise), is vital.

### GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1s): Weight & Heart Health

GLP-1s, like semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy) and liraglutide (Victoza), stimulate insulin, slow digestion, and reduce appetite. Many experience **significant weight loss** and **cardiovascular benefits**. Oral semaglutide (Rybelsus) offers a non-injectable option. Common side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) often improve over time; starting with a low dose and gradually increasing helps manage these. **Important:** GLP-1s are not for those with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2).

### Comprehensive Care & Practical Guidance

Your healthcare team will personalize your treatment, considering heart health, kidney function, and weight. Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise) are foundational for optimal outcomes. Other medication classes like sulfonylureas, TZDs, DPP-4 inhibitors, and insulin also exist and may be part of your plan.

When reviewing blood work:
*   **HbA1c:** Reflects average blood sugar. A common target is generally below 7%, but this is personalized. Typically checked 2-4 times a year.
*   **eGFR:** Indicates kidney function. Aim for above 60 mL/min/1.73m².
*   **UACR:** Shows kidney damage. Aim for below 30 mg/g.
Your doctor monitors these annually, especially with SGLT2i's.

Discuss medication costs with your team or pharmacist. Ask about patient assistance programs, manufacturer coupons, or insurance coverage options for potentially expensive newer drugs. Proactive engagement ensures the best long-term health.
