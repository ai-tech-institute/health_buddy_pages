# Type 2 Diabetes: Managing Blood Sugar for a Healthier You

Being newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes means learning to manage your blood sugar. Understanding and responding to both low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) blood sugar is crucial for your well-being. This guide provides actionable steps and essential information.

## Understanding Blood Sugar Levels

*   **Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar):** Blood glucose below **70 mg/dL**.
    *   **Symptoms:** Shakiness, sweating, confusion, dizziness, hunger, rapid heartbeat.
    *   **Action (Rule of 15):** Eat 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate (e.g., 4 glucose tablets, 4 oz juice, 1 tablespoon honey). Wait 15 minutes, recheck blood sugar. If still below 70 mg/dL, repeat. Once blood sugar is normal, eat a small snack or meal if your next meal is more than an hour away.
*   **Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar):** Blood glucose typically above **180 mg/dL**.
    *   **Symptoms:** Increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, blurred vision, headache.
    *   **Action:** Drink water to stay hydrated. Check for ketones if advised by your doctor. Contact your healthcare provider if blood sugar remains high or you have severe symptoms.

## Preventing Blood Sugar Swings

Prevention is key to stable blood sugar.
*   **Dietary Choices:** Aim for consistent meal times and balanced carbohydrate intake. A registered dietitian can help you create a personalized meal plan.
*   **Physical Activity:** Regular exercise, like walking or cycling, helps your body use glucose more efficiently. Discuss safe exercise routines with your doctor.
*   **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water is vital for overall health and can help manage blood sugar.

## Monitoring Your Blood Sugar

**Blood Glucose Monitoring (BGM)** using a finger-prick device, or **Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)**, which tracks levels automatically, are essential tools. They help you and your care team see how food, activity, and medication affect your blood sugar.

**Typical Blood Glucose Targets** (Your doctor will set individual goals):
*   **A1C:** Below 7% (average blood sugar over 2-3 months)
*   **Fasting (before meals):** 80-130 mg/dL
*   **Post-meal (1-2 hours after):** Below 180 mg/dL

## Your Diabetes Care Team

A multidisciplinary team supports your journey:
*   **Endocrinologist:** A doctor specializing in diabetes and hormone disorders.
*   **Diabetes Educator:** Provides practical guidance on self-management, monitoring, and lifestyle.
*   **Registered Dietitian:** Helps develop personalized eating plans.

## Medications

Your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage blood sugar. Common types include:
*   **Metformin:** Often a first-line medication, helps reduce glucose production by the liver.
*   **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists:** Help the body release insulin and slow digestion.
*   **SGLT2 Inhibitors:** Help the kidneys remove glucose from the body through urine.

## The Importance of Tracking

Keep a record of your blood glucose readings, food intake, physical activity, and medication times. This information helps you understand patterns and empowers your care team to make informed adjustments to your treatment plan, leading to better outcomes and a healthier life.
