# Recognizing and Responding to Diabetes Emergencies: A Caretaker's Guide

For primary caretakers of individuals with Type 2 diabetes, understanding and swiftly responding to emergencies can be life-saving. Beyond common blood sugar issues, nuanced signs and lesser-discussed complications demand immediate attention.

## Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

Watch for shakiness, sweating, confusion, sudden mood changes, difficulty concentrating, or nightmares. Hypoglycemia is blood sugar **below 70 mg/dL** (urgent action) or **below 54 mg/dL** (severe). For mild to moderate cases (conscious and able to swallow), use the **Rule of 15**: consume 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates (e.g., 4 oz juice), wait 15 minutes, recheck, and repeat if necessary.

**Nocturnal hypoglycemia** occurs during sleep; look for frequent headaches or unexplained tiredness. For severe cases, when the person is unconscious or unable to swallow, **glucagon** is crucial. It's prescribed by a doctor as an injectable or nasal spray. Follow kit instructions (e.g., intramuscular injection or nasal puff). Ensure you and emergency contacts know its location and administration. Always call 911 if unconscious or unable to swallow.

## Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar), DKA & HHS

Sustained high blood sugar can lead to **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)** or **Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS)**. Beyond excessive thirst and frequent urination, watch for **fruity-smelling breath** (DKA), profound weakness, or **neurological changes** (confusion, seizures) (HHS). These are medical emergencies.

In DKA, ketones are dangerous because they indicate the body is burning fat for fuel, making the blood acidic. For HHS, if conscious, encourage hydration with water or sugar-free fluids while awaiting medical help. A blood glucose reading consistently above 300 mg/dL, especially with ketones in urine, signals DKA risk. For HHS, glucose often exceeds 600 mg/dL without ketones, accompanied by severe dehydration. Always seek emergency medical care immediately for suspected DKA or HHS.

## Lesser-Known Complications & Practical Guidance

Be vigilant for **silent heart attacks** (new or worsening fatigue, persistent shortness of breath, unexplained nausea, jaw/back/arm discomfort), sudden vision changes, or persistent numbness/tingling. Seek emergency care for these symptoms.

**Practical Tips:**
*   Create a laminated emergency card with medical history, medications, and contacts.
*   Ensure the individual wears a medical alert bracelet or necklace.
*   Review blood glucose trends (related to meals, exercise, meds, illness) to inform healthcare discussions.
*   Understand **sick-day rules**: never stop insulin or critical medications unless advised by a doctor, drink plenty of fluids, and check blood sugar and ketones more frequently. Proactive communication with the healthcare team is paramount.
