# Type 2 Diabetes: Protecting Your Kidneys – Understanding eGFR, UACR, and Advanced Therapies

For individuals with Type 2 diabetes, proactive kidney health management is vital. Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a serious complication, but early detection and advanced therapies can significantly slow its progression. Understanding key diagnostic markers and treatment options empowers you to protect your kidneys.

## Essential Kidney Health Markers: eGFR and UACR

Regular monitoring of these two tests is crucial:

1.  **eGFR (estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate):** A blood test showing how well your kidneys filter waste.
    *   **Healthy:** Above 90 mL/min/1.73 m²
    *   **Early damage:** 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m²
    *   **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD):** Below 60 mL/min/1.73 m²
    *   **Action:** Track trends; a sustained decline is a red flag.

2.  **UACR (Urine Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio):** A urine test measuring protein (albumin) leakage, indicating kidney damage.
    *   **Normal:** Less than 30 mg/g
    *   **Microalbuminuria (early damage):** 30-300 mg/g
    *   **Macroalbuminuria (advanced damage):** Greater than 300 mg/g
    *   **Action:** Elevated UACR often precedes eGFR decline, offering a critical intervention window.

**Recommendation:** The American Diabetes Association (ADA) and other professional bodies recommend annual screening for both eGFR and UACR for all individuals with Type 2 diabetes.

## Advanced Therapies for Kidney Protection

Beyond traditional blood pressure and glucose management, newer medications offer significant kidney-specific benefits:

1.  **SGLT2 Inhibitors (e.g., dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, canagliflozin):**
    *   **FDA Approval:** Approved for glucose control and specifically to reduce cardiovascular events, heart failure hospitalization, and kidney disease progression in Type 2 diabetes with CKD.
    *   **Eligibility:** Often for eGFR as low as 20-30 mL/min/1.73m² and/or UACR > 200 mg/g.
    *   **Side Effects:** Common: UTIs, genital yeast infections, increased urination, dehydration. Serious (rare): Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Canagliflozin has a specific warning for lower limb amputations. Discuss these with your doctor.

2.  **GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., semaglutide, liraglutide):**
    *   **FDA Approval:** Primarily for glucose control and weight management, with increasing recognition for kidney and cardiovascular benefits (e.g., reduced albuminuria, slower eGFR decline).
    *   **Eligibility:** Considered for Type 2 diabetes patients needing glucose/weight management, with established cardiovascular disease, risk factors, or emerging kidney involvement.
    *   **Side Effects:** Common: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. Warnings: Pancreatitis risk, potential for thyroid C-cell tumors (contraindicated with personal/family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN 2).

3.  **Non-steroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (nsMRAs) – Finerenone (Kerendia):**
    *   **FDA Approval:** Specifically approved to reduce the risk of sustained eGFR decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with CKD associated with Type 2 diabetes.
    *   **Eligibility:** Typically for eGFR 25-75 mL/min/1.73m² and albuminuria, already on maximally tolerated ACE inhibitor or ARB, with persistently elevated albuminuria.
    *   **Side Effects:** Most important: Hyperkalemia (high potassium). Regular potassium monitoring is essential. Other: Hypotension (low blood pressure). Discuss all medications with your provider.

These advanced therapies represent a paradigm shift in managing DKD. Discussing these options with your healthcare provider is crucial to develop a personalized strategy for kidney protection.
